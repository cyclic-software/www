As a repeat founder I get the question from entrepreneurs and others: &quot;how do you get your first users?&quot;

  

For me, this is actually the easiest stage. I think of acquiring and growing a group of users differently based on the scale of the existing user base. There is a great book that talks about going 0 to 1 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zero\_to\_One). What I mean here is how to go from 0 users to 1 user.

  

In this case the first user is ... You.

You are the first user. Use your product before you launch. Every day. Selling meal kits? Well you eat every day don&#39;t you? There are very few startups where you can&#39;t be trying the product prior to launch on a daily or weekly basis.

  

The absolute best would be to go through the full onboarding process as a new user. Sometimes that is impractical. Don&#39;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good here. Daily is better than weekly, weekly is better than monthly. Set yourself a recurring meeting for an hour weekly.

When I was a cofounder of a citizen engagement service, I didn&#39;t use the platform daily and I think it showed. I wasn&#39;t immersed in the experience of being a user. I was external, guessing what users might want.

  

Now at Cyclic I try to push code everyday. The best days are when I build a new starter example and try to deploy for the first time. If you

Using my own products, I find I&#39;m annoyed by the incomplete features. Small ux issues can really grate on me. I think this is the point.

  
Repeat after me: "I am the first user. I am user number 1"
