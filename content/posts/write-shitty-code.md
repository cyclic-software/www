I know how to write good code.

  

Usually it means spending more time now to make the code better for some future state of the world. This assumes that I know what the future will look like. In software we rarely know what the future holds.

  

&gt; In software we rarely know what the future holds

‍

Uncertainty can be caused by:

*   Not knowing the technology
*   Not knowing the business
*   Not knowing the user
*   Not knowing the data size of the system
*   Not knowing the longevity of the code
*   Unknown-unknowns (see 2020 for more complete list of examples)

‍  

When I have uncertainty about the future, cycle time is most important. It allows me to capture value from my code by: learning as quickly as possible, minimizing impacts of bad or faulty code, as well as shortening my time to market.

  

Any friction hurts my cycle time. This decreases the rate I can turn uncertainty into certainty aka learning. My longest term value is created by learning as quickly as possible, since it is a multiplier for all future code I write or systems I design. Said another way: As &quot;writing is re-writing
