Dear Users,

We are shutting down Cyclic.

Effective immediately we are turning off signups by new users.

In two weeks, May 10th, we will begin turning off free tier usage.

We will begin turning off all usage May 31.


It has been a great learning experience building the community and the company. However we were not able to sell enough to make it self sustaining. It is now time to turn off the service. Thanks for your support and we hope you enjoyed the service.

We apologize for any trouble for the short timeline. 

-Kam
