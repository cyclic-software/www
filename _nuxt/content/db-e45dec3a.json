More on the round later. Multiple founder friends have asked about my experience and why I used an RUV. Here is the Why, What and How:\n\n  \n\n**TL;DR**\n=========\n\n  \n\n> A Roll Up Vehicle is a legal entity that can take investments from multiple investors or entities and then invest that money as a single entity on your company’s cap table. Here are the pros and cons for using an AngelList RUV as part of a venture capital fundraising round:\n\n‍  \n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/61034dd64ba727b1f9120503_angellist_ruv.png)\n\nVisual depiction of how investments are rolled up onto your captable\n\n**Pros**:\n---------\n\n*   Future rounds are simplified, exactly when most stressful\n*   Future rounds are cheaper ($)\n*   Investor's address and info is kept private\n*   Simplified e-signature and funding for investors and company at time of investment\n\n###   \n\n**Cons**:\n---------\n\n*   Some additional setup for the company (~1hr)\n*   Small additional cost (now only filing fees https://www.angellist.com/blog/eliminating-fees-for-roll-up-vehicles)\n*   Additional complexity describing to your investor who AngelList is and how they are involved\n\n  \n  \n\n### **Should I use a RUV?**\n\n  \n\nI would definitely recommend an AngelList RUV to anyone raising an early venture capital round where:\n\n  \n\n*   You expect to raise another round in the future \n\n  \n\nAnd one or more of these to apply:\n\n  \n\n*   You have 10 or more angels\n*   You have angels that do less than 4 deals a year\n*   You have angels writing checks for less than $25k\n\n  \n  \n\n### **Cyclic - What we do**\n\n  \n\nAs a developer the complexity to go from your local to the cloud is increasing. This is driving cloud platform selection into a pre-design time decision. We are dedicated to solving both of these problems for developers. Our goal is to let you push to deploy while making cloud environment selection a runtime decision. Sign up for the [Cyclic Private Beta](https://app.cyclic.sh/api/login)  \n‍[  \n](http://<a href=\"https://console.cyclic-app.com/api/login\" class=\"button white helloworld-cta w-button\">Deploy on Cyclic🚀</a>)\n\n### **My Past Experience**\n\n  \n\nAt the last company I co-founded, we raised a convertible note and then two priced rounds over the course of 7 years. The deal terms were reasonably standard for VC deals. They included drag along provisions. We were first time founders and I think we did an \"ok\" job of keeping all of our investors updated on how the company was doing.\n\n  \n\nDespite drag along rights (i.e. company able to \"drag\" small investors into a transaction if some percentage of shares in the company agree to the transaction), the lawyers involved with our second priced round wanted signed docs from all investors along with consent of spouse docs for any investment held by a person instead of trust or other entity. This meant that we needed to coordinate outreach to roughly ten angel investors, most of whom were non-professional angels. We needed to bring them up to speed on why we were raising, and explain we needed their signatures on documents for the round even though the company had drag along rights. Oh and by the way, we needed signatures from their spouses as well, leading them to have the same conversation with less fidelity with their spouse.\n\n  \n\nThe more experienced angels who had larger checks generally understood the process and were more likely to have entities which they used to make the original investment. So they were either less likely to have questions and most were able to be a sole signer on behalf of the entity that held the investment. The converse of this was also true. The smaller check angels were more likely to have questions, they were less familiar with what was standard and they were more likely to need signatures from a spouse. Additionally, it seemed that the less experienced angels were less engaged with email and had longer turn around times.\n\n  \n\nIn a vacuum, handling  each of these conversations is manageable. However, once a closing date was set,  all of these small \"punch list\" items seemed to bubble to the surface. It seemed that there was a spike in the length of items remaining once the date was set. The 7 to 14 days before closing are among the most stressful for a co-founder. In my experience, having extra tasks and communication on my plate was extra stress at exactly the wrong time.\n\n  \n\n> The 7 to 14 days before closing are among the most stressful for a co-founder... having extra tasks and communication on my plate was extra stress at exactly the wrong time.\n\n  \n\n### **Why an RUV**\n\n  \n\nThe RUV prevents the need to keep going back to the early angels. It is a legal structure where the angels have already agreed that someone designed by the RUV organizer will be able to sign future docs related to their investment. The designated person can sign any future fundraising documents. In my case, I am that designated signer.\n\n  \n\nThis means at the next funding round I will be able to sign on behalf of the RUV. So for a bit more time and cost upfront (and maybe a bit more complex conversation with the angels) I am able to decrease my complexity (and stress) at the time of each future funding round.\n\n  \n  \n\n### **How it works for Founders**\n\n  \n\nSign up and on-boarding were easy. I wrote a blurb on the company, uploaded a deck or memo, filled in some deal terms, identified notable co/lead-investors, targeted raise amount, and selected how I would pay the RUV fee (either company pays or investors pay). I didn’t have the exact form of the SAFE complete when I set up the RUV, it is only required at close, provided it is substantially the same terms as any of the listed co/lead investors.\n\n  \n\nFor me there was some email back and forth with the AngelList team since they were still doing a staged rollout when I signed up. I had some questions during setup and emailed with two people who work at AngelList. Both were responsive and helpful. The email support felt personal and attentive.\n\n  \n\nMy only complaints on the company product side are that the UI/UX was a bit complicated for just doing the RUV. It seemed it was more focused on syndicates and funds. If there is any \"product\" work for the AngelList team this is probably where it is. For example: to get to the RUV page you navigate via the \"Deals\" menu item and the deal is listed under my \"Syndicate\". This all sorta makes sense given the product is essentially a Syndicate where the fee and carry are 0%. However it doesn’t really make sense when I am the company founder doing a RUV. Additionally I didn’t find a way to set a per investor minimum, perhaps I just missed it in interface. These are minor points of friction but they left me with a feeling that it was still an early product that wasn’t fully polished yet.\n\n  \n  \n\n### **How it works for Investors**\n\n  \n\nThe investor side was smooth even for first time angels investing either personally or through an entity. The flow has e-signature to the RUV docs and the ability to enter bank account details so AngelList can initiate an ACH (electronic transfer). There is also the ability for the investors to wire if that is their preference.\n\n  \n\nThat is literally it. Smooth and easy.  \n  \n  \n\n### Thoughts?

Processes that used to produce [app/events/login-123123.json` are refactored to write `app/events/dt=yyyy-mm-dd/login-123123.json` instead.  \n‍_(Actually something like app/events/dt=yyyy-mm-dd/asdfasdfasdf.gz , building crawler schema to make parquet out of messy, dynamic json files is hard and you think you're smart and just enable gzip compression in firehose.)_  \n\n**Cool.** You configure the partition key `dt=yyyy-mm-dd` in the data catalog, write some documentation about how everyone should use date ranges to make queries efficient. All is well and the data science team can again do linear regressions aka \"Machine Learning\" to find out which events make the most money or, you know \"drive business kpis\". \n\n  \n\n### Back to our original problem\n\nSome time has passed and **you now have a shitload of data in S3**. Someone has noticed how much it costs and **now you have to clean it up**.  \n\nHopefully, AWS is holding your hand on this one - you're a really great customer obviously. They will tell you, the two options you have to clean stuff up are:\n\n*   **Delete objects one by one** manually by using the list and delete API’s _(yeah, sounds dumb)_\n*   **Set up lifecycle policies** at the bucket level to expire objects based on prefix rules _(this sounds promising!!)_\n\n  \n\nLifecycle policies are pretty great.\n\nThey work by first specifying a filter like:\n\n*   Apply by tag _(That would be sweet.. but no one tagged any of the objects that are already in there)_\n*   Apply by a size threshold _(There is no meaningful size difference between stuff you might want or not want)_\n*   Apply by prefix _(Yeeeah, that's the one)_\n\nThen specifying a rule like:\n\n*   Expire after some time has passed\n*   Move to a different storage class\n*   Delete older versions of objects\n\n###   \nStop the bleeding  \n\nWithout much research, the prefix filter thing looks really good. Naturally, as it is with filters, everyone would need to decide what they want to keep and not keep.  That sounds like a mess of calls and meetings. On that dilemma, the (actually good) advice from your partners at AWS -\n\n> \"Your costs are accumulating, we can help you move the really old stuff to Glacier to stop the bleeding.\"  \n> ‍_\\- AWS bros_\n\nThere are obvious tradeoffs with Glacier. But since large scale reads, especially ones on old data are not often done, after some short all-hands discussions everyone agrees.\n\n###   \nThe 100 thousand dollar button  \n\nYou go back and press the button in the console. A message comes up asking you to confirm that you are aware that:\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/620d170b68d74639eb4fe9f1_Screen%20Shot%202022-02-16%20at%2010.23.35%20AM.png)\n\nBut isn't there like a million billion objects?? How about a different storage class?  [Requests & data retrievals](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) > Lifecycle Transition requests into (per 1,000 requests). Even though the s3 console does not produce the ominous warning when selecting other storage classes, [transitional request charges apply](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html). **Fuuuuuuuuu  \n‍**  \nDoing metrics inventory with some help from AWS on your billions of json files and a little math - it is determined that **pressing this button will incur a one time cost of around $100,000**.    \n\n  \nVery few people (all non-technical) in the organization have the ability to authorize this. No one (or at least not the mere mortals) wants to be the one to give those people this news. There goes Plan A. On to plan B: Figure out what can be deleted.\n\n  \nBefore this gets escalated, you rush to set up meetings with stakeholders. Data science says keep all the logins but don’t care about logouts. The application team needs both but only for a week or so. Compliance says some things can be archived but archives must be kept for a year.  Complicated, but for now there is something to say at the status meetings - \"We're working on it.\"  \n\n> \"We're working on it.\"  \n> _\\- everyone in all status meetings_\n\n###   \nLifecycle policies are not magic\n\nFast forward through three months of weekly status meetings, working with different teams to document data retention requirements. Yes, the bills were paid, more stuff has been stored and costs have risen, but - **there is finally a list!**\n\nYou will archive the logouts after 30 days and delete after a year for compliance, logins will be kept for 6 months for the data science team, archived... etc. etc. \n\n‍\n\n**Now here is the twist.** Somehow over many meetings, AWS support calls, etc - the story of how prefix filters work has morphed into how everyone wanted it to work.  Checking back in with support - you find out that `app/events/\\*/login-\\*.json` and `app/events/\\*/logout-\\*.json` is not actually going to magically scan wildcard patterns. It's the flip side of the partitioning coin. **The thing that makes reads and writes so performant makes it impossible to implement wildcards in lifecycle policies.**\n\nHow did everyone come to the misunderstanding? (well other than by not reading the docs) Could it be coming across [similar language in docs for a different AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/policies-object-lifecycle-components.html) that does have wildcards? Skimming over [blog posts](http://www.deplication.net/2019/02/aws-tip-wildcard-characters-in-s3.html) on the subject? The [S3 docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html) not telling you explicitly that you can't do that? _(Comments welcome)_  \n\n###   \nThe truth\n\nFaced with this truth, the heroes realize that a lot of time has been put into crafting those rules, lists were made, arguments were had. There is no going back to Plan A now. A few sprints later - developer gets a user story: `**Use big-ass SageMaker to crawl s3 and clean up**` _(3 points)._ \n\n  \nWhether or not the org is still paying that bill has been lost to history but legend says that user story got de-prioritized.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n‍\n\n‍\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/aws-s3-why-sometimes-you-should-press-the-100k-dollar-button","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1660313773366},"$loki":4},{"slug":"aws-tools-suck","title":"AWS Tools Suck","summary":"If you have ever worked with AWS as a developer then you will know what I mean, AWS tools suck.

They suck so bad there is an entire industry focused on solving for this pile of suck. For just Infrastructure as Code, for example, there are Terraform, Pulumi and Serverless. AWS is famous for \"listening to customers\". So what gives? Why do their tools still feel clunky, complex and riddled with infuriating edge cases?  \n\n  \n\n### tldr\n\nYou, the developer, are not the customer.\n\n  \n\nThe longer answer is a combination of several factors. Here are my three reasons for why things are the way they are.\n\n  \n\n### Reason 1: AWS never was a developer tools company\n\n  \n\nAWS never won based on having the best experience or tooling. They offered one powerful value proposition, you could shorten your project lead time by using their services. You no longer need to do capacity planning for the number of disks (s3), servers (ec2) or network capacity (egregious egress). Oh, and they were fanatical about availability.\n\n  \n\n### Reason 2: AWS doesn't sell based on Dev Ex\n\n  \n\nAWS is growing at least as faster than the cloud market as a whole \\[1\\], yet they have below average developer experience. The only way that this can happen is if their customers are purchasing for reasons other than quality of developer tools. If the decision maker cared about developer experience why do they keep choosing AWS? The only reasonable answer is the person picking doesn't prioritize Dev Experience over some other attributes of the vendor (that is for another post).\n\n  \n\n### Reason 3: If AWS wanted it they would have it\n\n  \n\nGiven the near 1 billion dollar a week capital expense annual run rate AWS was at in Q4 of 2020 \\[2\\], if it was of strategic importance for them to solve for better tooling they would. This is not a case of \"not enough resources'', this is a case of the project not getting the internal priority to invest in improvement.\n\n  \n\n### Conclusion\n\n  \n\nAWS continues to grow despite having bad tooling and developer experience. If it impacted their sales they would make it a priority. If they made it a priority to have great tooling, they would have it. The only conclusion is: bad tooling isn't affecting their sales. Therefore, sales decisions aren't being made at the level or for the reasons that developer tooling changes the outcome.\n\n  \n\nWhich means AWS tools will continue to suck for the foreseeable future.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\\[1\\] [https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.platformonomics.com/2021/03/follow-the-capex-oracle-fy21-q3-update/](https://www.platformonomics.com/2021/03/follow-the-capex-oracle-fy21-q3-update/)\n\n  \n\n\" Considerations for Serverless Active-Active: Routing,considerations-for-serverless-active-active-routing,60d0f077b69e2df6b324616c,623b3aed20c9065ace10b837,Wed Mar 23 2022 15:21:17 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Apr 19 2022 16:03:40 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Jun 08 2022 20:06:23 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),mike-korostelev,AWS,false,false,Thu Mar 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/623b489a8dc82ac713edaba0\\_Screen%20Shot%202022-03-23%20at%2012.19.24%20PM.png,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/623b489a8dc82ac713edaba0\\_Screen%20Shot%202022-03-23%20at%2012.19.24%20PM.png,Building active-active in multiple regions can be expensive and complex.

Serverless-native applications can make it simpler to serve users globally and enable more effective recoveries with less effort.\n\nStarting from the end user making an http request and assuming there are two identical instances of an application running in two AWS regions - this and next several posts will discuss considerations, tools and solutions for building serverless active-active architectures.\n\n**Routing**\n-----------\n\nThe first touchpoint for a request is DNS routing. This where the cloud DNS ([AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)) connects the request to your application's endpoints - in whatever region they are in the world.\n\n#### Which regional instance of the application to send the request to?\n\nAWS Route53 lets you select a routing policy for DNS records. A regional policy will route users the closest geographic region ($0.70 per million queries). A latency policy will route to the the lowest query latency record ($0.60 per million queries). For high traffic web services, the TTL value should be considered as most web clients cache dns for the specified TTL.\n\nIf the record is configured as an alias to an AWS service (like cloudfront and api gateway) - the dns queries are free.\n\n#### How to know that the instance in the region is actually healthy ✅ before routing the request?\n\nIf a region is down (and it's not even your fault), Route53 does not know not to send requests there. To make Route53 know the state of an endpoint, health checks can be configured. Depending on the config, a health check is somewhere between $0.50 - $2.00 per month. Two ways to configure a health check are:\n\n*   Monitor an endpoint by continuously polling it from multiple regions - this will result in multiple requests per second to some endpoint where your application responds with some kind of 200. Since all these requests must be handled by something and can get expensive downstream from the traffic generated by the health check itself.\n*   Monitor cloudwatch alarms - this lets you be more creative about what ‘healthy’ means and can go both ways on cost/complexity. This option is likely going to have more lag than monitoring an endpoint directly.\n\nHere the TTL is a more important consideration - since clients will cache dns - faster health-check polling intervals will not give you instantaneous routing switchover. So if users are actively using a service at the moment the switch over happens, you should have the expectation that they may still be hitting the failing endpoint until their dns cache expires.\n\n**_The next few posts will discuss these and other considerations, approaches and dirty hacks for building a low overhead active-active strategy with serverless on AWS:_**\n\n#### **Compute**\n\n##### How to process the requests in both regions without having to pay for two computes?\n\n##### How to scale capacity if suddenly a single regional application instance must pick up the slack for a whole other region’s worth of traffic?\n\n#### **Data**\n\n##### How to make sure the data created by either regional application instance is available to the other?\n\n#### **Ops**\n\n##### Human decisions are political decisions, politics takes time, in a disaster time is scarce - how to remove humans from the process?\n\n##### How to manage infrastructure across multiple regions without multiplying operational overhead?\n\n#### **Latency**\n\n##### How to deal with eventual consistency and the fact that data replication is not instantaneous?\n\n‍\n\n\" Dad's Advice for How to Live,dads-advice-for-how-to-live,60d0f077b69e2df6b324616c,620d51d392f146f0cba97c8a,Wed Feb 16 2022 19:34:43 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Mar 02 2022 17:54:17 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Mar 02 2022 17:55:32 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),kam-lasater,Company,false,false,Mon Feb 21 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/621667437c7f8c36dd910873\\_dads-advice-20220223-v2.png,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/621667437c7f8c36dd910873\\_dads-advice-20220223-v2.png,\"I was 16 and about to head off as the youngest member of a month-long wilderness sailing trip.

Serverless-native applications can make it simpler to serve users globally and enable more effective recoveries with less effort.\n\nStarting from the end user making an http request and assuming there are two identical instances of an application running in two AWS regions - this and next several posts will discuss considerations, tools and solutions for building serverless active-active architectures.\n\n**Routing**\n-----------\n\nThe first touchpoint for a request is DNS routing. This where the cloud DNS ([AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)) connects the request to your application's endpoints - in whatever region they are in the world.\n\n#### Which regional instance of the application to send the request to?\n\nAWS Route53 lets you select a routing policy for DNS records. A regional policy will route users the closest geographic region ($0.70 per million queries). A latency policy will route to the the lowest query latency record ($0.60 per million queries). For high traffic web services, the TTL value should be considered as most web clients cache dns for the specified TTL.\n\nIf the record is configured as an alias to an AWS service (like cloudfront and api gateway) - the dns queries are free.\n\n#### How to know that the instance in the region is actually healthy ✅ before routing the request?\n\nIf a region is down (and it's not even your fault), Route53 does not know not to send requests there. To make Route53 know the state of an endpoint, health checks can be configured. Depending on the config, a health check is somewhere between $0.50 - $2.00 per month. Two ways to configure a health check are:\n\n*   Monitor an endpoint by continuously polling it from multiple regions - this will result in multiple requests per second to some endpoint where your application responds with some kind of 200. Since all these requests must be handled by something and can get expensive downstream from the traffic generated by the health check itself.\n*   Monitor cloudwatch alarms - this lets you be more creative about what ‘healthy’ means and can go both ways on cost/complexity. This option is likely going to have more lag than monitoring an endpoint directly.\n\nHere the TTL is a more important consideration - since clients will cache dns - faster health-check polling intervals will not give you instantaneous routing switchover. So if users are actively using a service at the moment the switch over happens, you should have the expectation that they may still be hitting the failing endpoint until their dns cache expires.\n\n**_The next few posts will discuss these and other considerations, approaches and dirty hacks for building a low overhead active-active strategy with serverless on AWS:_**\n\n#### **Compute**\n\n##### How to process the requests in both regions without having to pay for two computes?\n\n##### How to scale capacity if suddenly a single regional application instance must pick up the slack for a whole other region’s worth of traffic?\n\n#### **Data**\n\n##### How to make sure the data created by either regional application instance is available to the other?\n\n#### **Ops**\n\n##### Human decisions are political decisions, politics takes time, in a disaster time is scarce - how to remove humans from the process?\n\n##### How to manage infrastructure across multiple regions without multiplying operational overhead?\n\n#### **Latency**\n\n##### How to deal with eventual consistency and the fact that data replication is not instantaneous?\n\n‍\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/considerations-for-serverless-active-active-routing","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1660313773433},"$loki":6},{"slug":"dads-advice-for-how-to-live","title":"Dad's Advice for How to Live","summary":"I was 16 and about to head off as the youngest member of a month-long wilderness sailing trip.

The hardest ones to debug are intermittent or inconsistent. How do I fix what works sometimes? If a line of code always breaks then the fix is direct. The system is linear. The action leads to a failure.\n\n‍\n\nHow do I debug a bug that is intermittent? How do I debug something that works sometimes?\n\n‍\n\nHere are some reminders to myself next time I encounter a baffling debugging session.\n\n‍\n\nChoose Learning\n---------------\n\n‍\n\nMy greatest learnings come from debugging. This bug is an opportunity for me to learn more about this system. If I already knew what was causing the problem then I wouldn't have a bug. The fact that I have a bug that isn’t obvious to me on how to fix, by definition means I have a chance to learn.\n\n‍\n\nThe system is giving me the gift of the chance to learn.\n\n‍\n\nChoose to take the opportunity to learn.\n\n‍\n\nChase the Error\n---------------\n\n‍\n\nAnswer the question: \"how do I make this fail every single time?\"\n\n‍\n\nInstead of continuing to make the system work. Instead make the system fail. Go straight at the error. Maximize it. Increase the error rate. Trigger the error repeatedly.\n\n‍\n\nFocus on driving the error rate to 100%. Only then can I be sure any success is from my action and not inconsistency.\n\n‍\n\nMake predictions to test my understanding: \"The system will fail, now (pushes button)\"\n\n‍\n\nSimplify\n--------\n\n‍\n\nOnce I can create the error on demand, I isolate. I begin simplifying the steps to trigger. Remove steps or hard code responses. Trim excess complexity not needed to cause error.\n\n‍\n\nIf it takes 6 steps to reproduce, try turning each one off in order.\n\n‍\n\nFind the minimum degrees of freedom to still reproduce the error.\n\n‍\n\nAssess the Inverse\n------------------\n\n‍\n\nReminder: the error is not caused by something I understand. Look explicitly for areas where I assume the system is working.\n\n‍\n\nWhat are the parts of the system that I am sure are working? What if they weren’t working as I expected? Verify the components are actually working as I expect.\n\n‍\n\nReminder: It’s not what we don’t know that gets us into trouble, it is what we know for sure that isn't true\n\n‍\n\nDevise a Conclusive Measure\n---------------------------\n\n‍\n\nBrainstorm what report, measure, logging or data would definitely tell me what is causing the error. Maybe this won't tell me \"why\" the error is happening, but point me closer to \"where\" the error is being caused.\n\n‍\n\nQuestion: What piece of information would conclusively tell me what the problem was?\n\n‍\n\nTake a Break\n------------\n\n‍\n\nI might be making things worse. If I don’t know what causes the error I don’t know if I’m making it worse. If the situation allows for it, take a break.\n\n‍\n\nGet some air. Go for a walk. Breath.\n\n‍\n\nA clear relaxed mind is open for new ideas.\n\n‍\n\nSleep on it. Pick it up tomorrow.\n\n‍\n\nExplain How to Reproduce\n------------------------\n\n‍\n\nSay it out loud.\n\nTalk to myself.\n\nExplain the steps to reproduce.\n\nStart at the beginning.\n\nBack up three steps and explain again.\n\nSlower this time.\n\n‍\n\nSummary\n-------\n\n‍\n\nHopefully this helps you debug an issue you are struggling with.

The goal is to share ways that a \"friend of mine\" has failed at serverless to help level up the community. Just as the transportation industry shares accident report analysis with the whole industry to improve safety, we in the software community need to do the same. This is my attempt to do that.  \n\n  \n\nI'm sure there is some product X that has feature Y that fixes issue Z. I either didn't know about it at the time, didn't have the budget, couldn't get it through vendor/security review, product wouldn’t schedule it with our engineers or it didn't comply with enterprise architecture's plan for our software roadmap. As some guy once said: \"You go to production with the tools you have, not the tools you want.\"\n\n  \n\n**Note:**‍\n\n*   Names have been changed to protect the innocent and not so innocent.\n*   Only egos (and wallets) were harmed by the failures recounted here.\n\n  \n\n**Serverless is Stateless**\n===========================\n\n  \n\nAll the architecture posts talk about serverless as stateless computing. How serverless is so scalable because it scales out to satisfy increased load, and scales in when not needed. This all makes sense. Lambda is like a big thread pool in the sky. Got it.\n\n  \n\nI can set some parameters to manage the maximum and minimum number of threads and AWS would handle all the hard work of hosting, spinning up, spinning down and networking the instances together. Awesome-sauce.\n\n‍\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62c86713fed3b513be122ce8_i-dont-remember.gif)\n\nlambda be like  \n\n  \n\nWell, almost...\n\n  \n\n### **Use Case**\n\n  \n\nBackground job that receives batches (10's-100's) of PDFs from the client, splits them apart into individual pages (1-1000 per PDF) and does analysis on each page. The arrival rate from the client is lumpy. Primarily US working hours on a 5 min interval. Response is measured in hours. This feels like a perfect HelloWorld use case for StepFunctions doing orchestration and Lambda doing image manipulation.\n\n  \n\n#### Lambda logic:\n\n*   Invoke with S3 path to file\n*   Read 10+mb files from S3 to /tmp\n*   Process file\n*   Write results to S3\n*   Respond with S3 path to transformed file\n\n‍\n\nServerless FTW!\n\n  \n\nEverything works great until... inconsistent out of disk space errors, or no space left on device (depending on your OS/language stack).\n\n  \n\nHow to Fail\n-----------\n\n  \n\n### **Problem**\n\n  \n\nPeriodically a step function run will fail due to a Lambda invoke failing on no space left on device (or similar depending on os and language). Running the same file in dev/test doesn't reproduce the error. Re-running the step function in production succeeds.\n\n‍\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62c866a26c2399e457733a1f_lambda-pac-man.png)\n\nlambda pac man loves eating data and leaving it in /tmp\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### **Solution**\n\n  \n\nWell... lambda instances have a writable `/tmp` folder where you can store temporary files. And somewhere in the AWS docs they describe how instances of your Lambda function are reused between invocations.\n\n  \n\nSome quick googling gets you a solution of clearing `/tmp` at the start and/or end of each invocation ([stack overflow ftw](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44108712/aws-lambda-release-tmp-storage-after-each-execution)). Till that fix makes it to production you can just re-execute any failed step function runs.\n\n  \n\nNothing quite like shipping code copy-pasted from Stack Overflow. Nice.\n\n  \n\nSuccess! Party!  \n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62c867cdc310db14bbac6405_leo-congrats.gif)\n\nStack Overflow code FTW!\n\n  \n\n‍\n\nuntil... wait what? out of memory errors? WTF!\n\n  \n\n### **Problem v2**\n\n  \n\nPeriodically a step function run fails. The Lambda invoke error is no memory left (or similar depending on os and language). Running the same file in dev/test doesn't reproduce the error. Re-running the step function in production succeeds. Turning on debug or releasing new builds adding additional logging suppress the error rate. WTF (why the failure?) Load tests don't reproduce the error.\n\n  \n\nThe explanation that AWS just fails on 1 in ~100k lambda invokes starts to wear thin with your Ops team that is getting paged to click a button. But we could just automate the re-run!\n\n  \n\nDeep inside accepting it \"just fails\" violates some axiom about how computers works. This is knowable and damn-it I shall know. So you strap the lambda down setting max concurrency to 1. Turn up the load test. Let’s do this.\n\n  \n\nAt 12k documents the lambda invoke fails for out of memory. Interesting.\n\n  \n\nRerun the load test. At 12k documents the lambda invoke fails for out of memory.\n\n  \n\nIf an error is repeatable it isn't random. 12k is an important number. It also happens to be the maximum number of file descriptors allowed for the linux OS the lambda is running on.\n\n  \n\nBack to google. Apparently the image manipulation library I am using has a history of bugs with leaving open file descriptors. Looks like each invoke to lambda is leaving another file descriptor open in the OS file descriptor table.\n\n  \n\nThe lambda will then fail when it hits 12k unless it is recycled. The lambda instance can be recycled due to:\n\n*   a code deployment: new code, new instances\n*   update to environment variable: hence why turning on debugging suppressed errors.\n*   scaling down: a burst in load will scale out new instances and then scale back down. Only some instances survive.\n\n  \n\n### **Solution v2**\n\n  \n\nExpand the IAM role permissions to allow the lambda permission to update itself (your security team might give you side eye for this, fair warning, send them this blog post, I'm sure it will convince them).\n\n  \n\nAfter completing the work of an invoke, call the lambda api to set an environment variable to a random value. We dubbed this the \"self-immolation\" solution.\n\n  \n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62c868256c23997e757361fa_lambda-self-immolation.png)\n\nThis lambda will self destruct in 3... 2... 1...\n\n  \n\nHacky? Yeah.\n\n  \n\nChaos for the lambda team? Probably.\n\n  \n\nDid it work? Yes.\n\n🤷  \n\n=====\n\n‍\n\nStay tuned, for more stories of #fail.\n\n  \n\n‍\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/how-to-fail-at-serverless-serverless-is-stateless","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1660313773514},"$loki":9},{"slug":"how-to-go-from-0-to-1","title":"How to go from 0 to 1 - Growing users for a new product or service","summary":"Going from 0 to 1.

And you probably dealt with [the \"framework dilemma\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ux2ov8/how_do_you_guys_determine_which_frameworks_to_use/) at some point in your career.\n\nSome of us pursue React, the [most popular framework](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-webframe-want). And that’s completely understandable, because it being famous also implies that it’s the most demanded skill in the job market.\n\nNext up is Vue, and its second position in the popularity spectrum. Some people prefer Vue for the fact that it’s so lightweight and yet so scalable, and others love its simplicity and similarity to other frameworks.\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62d6d1173d02703377a9cef3_top-liked-frameworks.png)\n\nLet’s take a leap of faith and change our selection criteria from popularity to likability.\n\nSvelte is the most loved framework, and for good reason. Svelte places strong emphasis on developer happiness because it's so easy to pick up and has a compiler that is more efficient than its peers.\n\nI always wondered how different it would be to build the **same app** with the same features, but in **3 different frameworks**. For each one, I want to answer the following questions:\n\n*   How many errors will I encounter?\n*   How much code is there to write?\n*   How long does it take to build?\n\nWe’ll be exploring each of the aforementioned frameworks in its own piece, as part of a four-article series.\n\nWe’ll build a [website for publicly sharing short-messages, called **\"ithink\"**](https://ithink.cyclic.app/). It’s like Twitter, but with no accounts and you can’t delete what you post.\n\n‍<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"gOerqjg\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/gOerqjg\">\n  It's Twitter, but you can't delete.</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nBut first, we need an API\n-------------------------\n\nIf you play around with the CodePen above, you’ll quickly realize that the database is not fake.\n\nWe actually have a [back-end side of our application](https://github.com/ithink-corp/api): it handles the storing and retrieving of simple text data. It’s also built on [Amazon’s S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) object storage service.\n\nA developer would normally spend hours and hours setting-up a database like this, and it’s not free either.\n\nLuckily for us, we get a free instance of the AWS S3 Storage when we [use Cyclic](https://app.cyclic.sh/). No credit card is required.\n\n[![https://deploy.cyclic.app/button.svg](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62d6cf389192e7f60cbda7b0_button.svg)](https://deploy.cyclic.sh/ithink-corp/api)\n\n‍\n\nVue, the lightweight framework\n------------------------------\n\nLet’s start by exploring the wonders of Vue, the framework that [claims itself to be one of the most performant frontend frameworks](https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html#is-vue-fast).\n\n### Creating a new project\n\nIt’s no secret that setup is one of the most important stages in a project’s lifecycle. It’s the very first step in the journey that transforms an idea into a real-life, working application that runs on a modern computer.\n\nWe can all agree that creating a boilerplate from scratch is exhausting. I mean, think about all the folders, files, and code that you’d need to keep repeating, forever. No one wants to do all that work!\n\nLuckily, Vue does all the work for us when we run the following command:\n\n`npm init vue@latest`\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions so you can create the optimal setup that best fits your project. So go ahead, and accept/reject the following questions:\n\n*   Project name: **ithink**\n*   TypeScript? **No**\n*   JSX Support? **No**\n*   Vue Router? **No**\n*   Pinia? **Yes**\n*   Vitest? **No**\n*   Cypress? **No**\n*   ESLint? **No**\n*   Prettier? **No**\n\nWe’ll see what each of these means throughout this article.\n\nNext up is installation. This time, you don’t have to do anything. Just kick-back, relax, and wait for `yarn` to do its work! (of course, you can also use `npm` if that’s your preference)\n\n```sh\ncd ithink\nyarn install # or npm install\n```\n\n\n‍<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"oNqxVBY\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/oNqxVBY\">\n  vue-0</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nThis command will create a dead-simple boilerplate which comes with some defaults. Go ahead and run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` and open up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. It’s already looking great, isn’t it?\n\nYou’ll see a semi-usable application describing Vue, with the addition of some links to its inner-workings.\n\nUnfortunately, most of this stuff is useless to us. Therefore, we’ll erase most of it so that we can continue along this guide:\n\nTake some time to observe the folder structure. Notice the emphasis that it places on [decoupling](https://jamstack.org/glossary/decoupling/). Everything is where it’s supposed to be, making it a very clean and elegant architecture to work on.\n\n```\ntree .\n├── index.html\n├── package.json\n├── public\n│   └── favicon.ico\n├── README.md\n├── src\n│   ├── App.vue\n│   ├── components\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.js\n│   └── stores\n├── vite.config.js\n└── yarn.lock\n```\n\nDon’t worry if this looks intimidating. We’ll cover _all of it_ throughout this document.\n\n### Configuring SEO\n\nYou might have noticed that the title of our document is _\"Vite App\"_, with no immediately obvious way of changing it.\n\nIt turns out that this is a great opportunity for us to delve into the first element: `index.html`. You’ve undoubtedly already seen this filename in a billion other places, but probably not in the context of Vue.\n\nSo let’s dive into `index.html`, and update some defaults:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n    - <title>Vite App</title>\n    + <title>ithink</title>\n    + <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Global online messaging, void of any borders.\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWe changed the title and added a description. Hence, quite simply, index.html is the entry-point to our application. It’s where you modify the `<head>` meta-tags, add class-names to the top-most elements such as `<body>` and `<html>`, and change the language of your website from English (\"en\") to say, French (\"fr\").\n\nIt’s also impossible to avoid speaking about `<div id=\"app\"></div>`. As we’ll see in an upcoming section, this is where all-things-Vue are injected. So let’s keep on exploring!\n\n### Changing the body color\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"BarKMEw\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/BarKMEw\">\n  vue-1</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>‍\n\nThe website we’re building has an overall dark theme, meaning that the `<body>` color should be changed from white to dark.\n\nAfter [configuring TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), we’ll start adding these changes to our document.\n\nYou must’ve already created a `src/index.css` file during your Tailwind configuration, and imported it from `src/main.js`. So, let’s add our custom styles:\n\n```css\n/* index.css */\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind utilities;\n@tailwind components;\n\nbody {\n  @apply bg-stone-900;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we’re using the `@apply` directive to _apply_ the `bg-stone-900` utility to the body. If you’re not very Tailwind-savvy, `bg-stone-900` is equivalent to the following CSS declaration:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background: #1c1917;}\n```\n‍\n\n### Adding a header\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"qBoZvrN\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/qBoZvrN\">\n  vue-2</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nIt’s time to delve into our second-most element: App.vue. It’s the top-most component of our application.\n\nWhatever you put inside this file will go straight into `<div id=\"app\"></div>`. Remember it? We mentioned it in the last paragraph of the section that covered `index.html`. See how it all fits together? Magical!\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62e02ea8cb6f0b99cc5ba095_hierarchy.png)\n\nAnd with all that said, let’s implement our overly-simplistic header:\n\n```html\n<template>\n    <!-- App.vue -->\n    <header>\n        <h1>ithink</h1>\n        <button>New</button>\n    </header>\n</template>\n```\n\nAs you can see, we kept it pretty simply.\n\nHey! I hid the Tailwind class-names from the code snipped above. Browse our code repository to see the full code.\n\n**_Ahem_**_,_ let’s address the elephant in the room. What the heck is `<template>`?\n\n* Before we get into that, let me explain a fundamental concept to you.. **Web components!**\n* Web components give developers the ability to create their own tags:\n* `<profile-card>`, `<emoji>`, `<close-button>`, `<code-editor>`\n* **_It’s like magic!_** You get to encapsulate your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web components are an elegant way to create user-interfaces that resemble native apps. They’re the future of the web.\n* If this sounds cool to you, you’re probably wondering how to create these things.\n\nSo let me introduce… **Single File Components!** (SFCs)\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    // Javascript here\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <!-- HTML here -->\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n    /* CSS here */\n</style>\n```\n\nAs you can see, SFCs split a component’s design into three logical parts, and they can come in any order:\n\n*   **JavaScript logic:** (`<script setup>`) The brains of your component. Handles state, events, networking, etc…\n*   **HTML document:** (`<template>`) The semantics of your component.\n*   **CSS declarations:** (`<style scoped>`) The style of your component.\n\nPretty neat, huh?\n\n### Listening to click events\n\nAs it currently stands, the \"new\" button doesn’t do anything, and no one wants a useless button.\n\nSo let’s change that! We must listen to a click event, and [in Vue, events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html) work like this:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    function openModal() {\n        // TODO\n        alert('button clicked!')\n    }\n</script>\n<template>\n    <button @click=\"openModal\">New</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nWe’ll come back to the openModal function later, when we actually create the modal!\n\n### Creating a modal component\n\nIt’s time to put the src/components folder to good use. This is where we’ll be housing all our custom components.\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"VwXaRbb\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/VwXaRbb\">\n  vue-3</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nWhat you can see in the image above is the \"New Modal\" component, written into the NewModal.vue file.\n\nCreate a new file at `src/components/NewModal.vue`. Fill it up with the usual SFC boilerplate:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    // NewModal.vue\n</script>\n\n<template>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n</style>\n```\n\nLet’s get the markup out of the way: (remember to use [the right semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics))\n\n‍\n\nMarkup alone is not very useful without the JavaScript logic. Let’s attach event handlers to our button elements:\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nOkay, this is great! But notice that when you click on \"post\", the page reloads. This is the default [behavior of HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form).\n\nNormally, we’d change that by calling `e.preventDefault`. But Vue focuses so much on simplicity that there’s a super-convenient shortcut:\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nWould you look at that! We’re able to shorten e.preventDefault() to @submit.prevent. Now, we don’t even need to consider [the Event object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) anymore!\n\n### Tracking a loading state\n\nThe user should know when their application is loading, whether it’s posting new text to the server or just retrieving it.\n\nLet’s create a variable that tracks when our component is sending/receiving data to/from the server. We’re gonna be using [reactive variables](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html).\n\n‍\n\nWhat is a **reactive variable**?\n\n*   Consider the following scenario:\n\n‍  \n\n*   Say that we updated the value in a to 5. One thing we know for sure is that the `<p>` element won’t change. It will always say \"4\", unless we explicitly change it.\n*   Well, we don’t have to! With [reactivity](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html), the DOM is automatically updated once the related variable is mutated.\n*   In Vue, reactive variables are created with ref, a function that takes any value and makes it reactive.\n\n‍  \n\n*   Notice the addition of .value. It’s important, because if we did a = 5 we’d completely taking away the reactivity of the variable.\n*   Also, it doesn’t matter that a is a constant variable, because we’re only assigning to its .value property.\n*   Now look at the HTML:\n\n‍  \n\n*   Vue will replace {{ a }} with its value: a.value, and the double-brackets are _not_ optional.\n\n‍\n\nOkay, let’s head right back into the submit logic. We’ll create a new isLoading reactive variable, which will indicate when our app is in-contact with the server.\n\n‍\n\n### Getting user input from form elements\n\nOur \"new modal\" component can’t exist without the `<textarea>` form element. But this raises an important question: _how do we keep the javascript code in-sync with the DOM content?_\n\nIn a nutshell, Vue has a shortcut way of dealing with form elements. And it’s quite convenient!\n\n‍\n\nAs you can see, message is a reactive variable, so whenever the user types something into textarea, message will be instantly updated. That’s the magic of v-model!\n\nHey! You may be getting tired from typing .value all the time. Thankfully, Vue has plans to change that.\n\n### Making the modal inert while loading\n\nWhen our app is loading (which is tracked by the isLoading variable that we saw in a previous section), we should disable interaction with it.\n\nThis requires us getting access to a DOM element in JavaScript. The pure way of doing that is with body.querySelector(), but this approach is non-reactive. Plus, there’s a simpler alternative offered by Vue:\n\n‍\n\nThese are called [template refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html)! And although it says null, Vue will fill container with the DOM element <div ref=\"container\"> when it’s created. It will also go back to null when it disappears.\n\nWith this in hand, we can make our component inert while it’s loading:\n\nHey! While there’s a simpler way to achieve the above (`<div :inert=\"isLoading\">`), I just had to create an opportunity to teach you about template refs, which are a pretty important feature in VueJS.\n\n### Automatically focusing the <textarea>\n\nWhen the user opens the NewModal component, we know that their objective is to input into the `<textarea>`. So, wouldn’t it be convenient to save them the hassle of moving the cursor towards that form element?\n\nLet’s implement this feature! Counter-intuitively, we can’t do this:\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nThe above code won’t work, because it’s the same as saying null.focus().\n\nSo, how do we tell Vue to only focus the textarea once it’s available? The answer lies in [**lifecycle hooks**](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html).\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62e02ecd52420b19a8e6d301_lifecycle.png)\n\nWe want to utilize the \"mounted\" hook, which is called right after the component is added to the DOM. That’s when the <textarea> is shown, meaning that it’s not null:\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nThere are many more lifecycle hooks, and we usually use most of them. However, in our application, the \"mounted\" hook was more than enough. But just keep one thing in mind, you’ll see this concept again and again in every framework.\n\n### Closing the modal when clicked outside\n\nIt’s a pretty common behavior in every modal to close it once the user clicks outside.\n\nIn this step, we’ll take a HUGE shortcut. Instead of manually implementing this behavior, we shall use another library to do it for us.\n\nThe Vue community is humongous and infinitely helpful, so it’s not a surprise to find a library like [@vueuse](https://vueuse.org/functions): over 200 useful methods that cover almost every possible use–case.\n\nOur interest lies in the \\[onClickOutside event\\]([https://vueuse.org/core/onClickOutside/](https://vueuse.org/core/onClickOutside/)), which is triggered every time the user clicks outside a certain DOM element.\n\nAfter [setting up @vueuse](https://vueuse.org/guide/), let’s add it to our component:\n\n‍\n\nFascinating how in one line of code, we’re able to implement such a seemingly complicating feature!\n\n### Closing the modal\n\nThe modal has no way of telling whether its opened or closed, as only its parent — App.vue — knows such information.\n\nBut there’s one thing we know to be true, and it’s that the modal knows _when_ it should be closed:\n\n*   user clicked outside,\n*   user submitted,\n*   user canceled.\n\nTherefore, we need a way for the child — NewModal — to communicate with its parent, App. And the solution is quite simple: [Events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html)!\n\nWith Vue, it’s super-simple to define our own events, while dictating when they should be emitted, using _our_ own rules.\n\nHenceforth, whenever the modal needs to be closed, we emit the event \"close\" up into its parent.\n\nHey! Notice how we didn’t import defineEmits. That’s because it’s a compiler macro, so it’s always there by default.\n\n### Using our custom component\n\nUp until now, you couldn’t see NewModal, because it hasn’t been added to App.vue yet. So, let’s change that:\n\nWith the code snippet above, the modal will always be open. So, let’s add some toggle magic:\n\nWe took advantage of `v-if` to show/hide the modal.\n\nAnd now we’re done with the NewModal component. Pretty simple, huh?\n\n### Creating a dynamic list of DOM elements\n\nIt’s time to delve into a new component, ThoughtList. This one will display a list of items, and we don’t know the length of that list before-hand.\n\nLet’s create a new file at `src/ThoughtList.vue`. In Vue, here’s how we repeat an element:\n\nSurprisingly simple! It might be useful to split this component into two: `ThoughtList.vue` and `ThoughtItem.vue`.\n\nSo, we’ll change `src/ThoughtList.vue` to:\n\nand the new `ThoughtItem.vue` will contain:\n\nAnd of course, don’t forget to add it to `App.vue`:\n\n### Passing text from parent to child\n\nWe’ve seen how to trigger events from child to parent, and now, it’s time to _flip_ that formula around.\n\nCurrently, our `ThoughtItem` displays the same text: \"Hello world!\"\n\nBut we want to show real data, which is held by the parent — `ThoughtList` — in the `items` reactive variable.\n\nThe solution to this problem is called **Props** (properties). They’re like HTML attributes, if they could contain _anything_! (arrays, objects, and even functions!)\n\nSo let’s make a little change to `ThoughtList.vue`:\n\nHey! It’s important to add the colon : before the prop name. It tells Vue to treat the content between \"...\" as JavaScript code (the item variable), instead of a String (the text \"item\").\n\nAnd now, we can access the text message in `ThoughtItem` effortlessly:\n\n‍\n\nHey! Just like defineEmits, defineProps is a compiler macro and doesn’t require importing.\n\n### Loading data from the server\n\nUp until now, we only used mock data. So, let’s change that! We’ll be getting data from an external API.\n\nBut first, notice that we’ll need to access our API from two separate components: ThoughtList for retrieving all items, and NewModal for adding new items to the [l](https://docs.cyclic.sh/docs/concepts/database)ist.\n\nThis is called a [shared-state](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management.html#what-is-state-management) between multiple components. There’s no immediately obvious way of solving this issue, but thankfully, there’s an entire library designed just for that, and it’s called [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).\n\nThis is where we’ll start working with the stores/ folder. So let’s create the src/stores/thoughts.js file.\n\n‍\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62e02ef269d01d02c0b009f1_pinia.png)\n\n‍\n\nA store should always resemble this boilerplate, so use it as a starting-point:\n\n‍\n\nWe created a store with the \"thoughts\" ID name.\n\nBut _what_ is a store, you may ask? It’s simply a collection of reactive variables and methods that act on them:\n\n‍\n\nNotice how we don’t have to use .value here. Awesome!\n\nNow, let’s create an actually useful store:\n\nAll we did here is declare an items reactive variable that will contain our most important data. We then defined the load method that should be called to load data from the server and assign it to items.\n\nWe also defined the add action, which asynchronously sends data to the server and adds it to the items list.\n\n### Using real data in our application\n\nLet’s connect our thoughts store with our application! We’ll start with NewModal:\n\n‍\n\nWe extracted the add function from the store by calling it as a function. Here, we called it getThoughtsStore, which is a convention when using Pinia.\n\nWould you believe me if I told you that was it? Well, I never lie.\n\nLet’s move into ThoughtList, which will load data from the server in order to display it.\n\nAnd we also have to access the items reactive variable straight from the store. So let’s follow the same pattern here:\n\nBut counter-intuitively, this breaks the reactivity of the variable. Here’s the right way of doing this:\n\nPerfect!\n\nNotice how in our previous code example, we’re using a top-level await to load the data in ThoughtList:\n\n‍\n\nComponents with [top-level awaits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46515764/how-can-i-use-async-await-at-the-top-level) are called **async components**.\n\nIf we leave it like this, we’re gonna get the following error: (check your devtools console)\n\nComponent `<Anonymous>`: setup function returned a promise, but no `<Suspense>` boundary was found in the parent component tree. A component with async setup() must be nested in a `<Suspense>` in order to be rendered.\n\nIt’s telling us that we should use a component called `<Suspense>` as a parent to the `async component](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async.html). [<Suspense>` (see: https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html) is a built-in Vue component, so we can use it anywhere in our app. Let’s use it in App.vue:\n\nIt now works _perfectly_! Yay!\n\n### Adding a loading state to our list\n\nCurrently, our ThoughtList component will be invisible until data is loaded. That’s inconvenient, and makes a great example of [bad UX](https://pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-loading-feedback/).\n\nThankfully, since we’re already using `<Suspense>`, we can directly tell it to show something else while its child is loading. Add this to App.vue:\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nAs you can see, anything within `<template #fallback>` will be shown when ThoughtList is loading. Awesome!\n\nBut we can get even awesome-r than that. Let’s show a [loading skeleton](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a)!\n\nYou should know that i in 15 is a shortcut that Vue offers us to loop over the range \\[1, …, 15\\]. Super!\n\nAnd with that done, our app is now **complete!** Now that wasn’t so hard, was it?\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe covered a handy amount of Vue features:\n\n*   [Suspense](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html) and [async components](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async.html),\n*   [the @vueuse library](https://vueuse.org/functions),\n*   [reactive variables](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html),\n*   [skeleton loading](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html),\n*   [custom events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html),\n*   [lifecycle hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html),\n*   [template refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html),\n*   [v-for](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html) and [v-if](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html),\n*   [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).\n\nSome of these are common to all web frameworks, while some aren’t. We’ll compare Vue with the rest of its peers at the end of this series, so I suggest you keep on reading! Trust me, there’s a whole lot more to learn! 😄\n\n‍\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/i-made-the-same-app-3-times-in-3-different-frameworks-heres-what-i-learned","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1660313773675},"$loki":12},{"slug":"its-always-sunny-in-us-east-1","title":"Its Always Sunny in us-east-1: The gang does business continuity","summary":"The gang experiences an AWS outage; customers report SHOWSTOPPERs; the gang triages the issues and attempts to implement an elaborate disaster recovery plan","colId":"60d0f077b69e2df6b324616c","id":"623b2c46371050340e82e69e","createdAt":"2022-03-23T14:18:46.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-19T13:33:52.000Z","publishedOn":"Tue Apr 19 2022 13:33:52 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","author":"mike-korostelev","category":"AWS","hidden":false,"featured":false,"public":"Thu Mar 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","image":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/623b4df73710503348866d01_Screen%20Shot%202022-03-23%20at%2012.42.07%20PM.png","thumbnail":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/623b4df73710503348866d01_Screen%20Shot%202022-03-23%20at%2012.42.07%20PM.png","toc":[{"id":"the-triage-process","depth":2,"text":"The triage process"},{"id":"some-people-on-twitter-are-saying-aws-is-having-an-outage-in-us-east-1","depth":3,"text":"\"Some people on twitter are saying AWS is having an outage in us-east-1\""}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"TLDR: The gang experiences an AWS outage; customers report SHOWSTOPPERs; the gang triages the issues and attempts to implement an elaborate disaster recovery plan"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It is 11:03 AM on a Thursday, US-EAST-1, Pennsylvania.

You've been triple booked just right and everyone at each call thinks you're at the other call. In this rare moment of freedom, you are adding custom emojis to slack.\n\nA message from a developer:\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/623b2bac320ad6b1f2c29c14_nb5Pt8iNWIeakqh64ZRzCdyvwQJoh5dqa3DLMw3VuRharHKff1CBXKBUKWtXIIxBIXOcFpaMW6VXC-vq9STLnr4_H1O16CU8P2N6jGPXMaiaa7njhzSLGvsqih8h-zkX0OIMDeLs.png)\n\n*   \"dude you free? we're having failures in prod.\"\n\nThis is unfortunate, it is your week on support rotation so the other calls cant get you out of this one.\n\nThe triage process\n------------------\n\nYou've crafted your triage process over many incidents and honed cutting diagnostic inquisitions. The goal here is efficiency and the mitigation of risk to lunchtime and as always, the secondary objective to expose the truth about how the PR comment you left was ignored and best practices spitefully neglected.\n\n**1\\. Estimate priority**: Did a customer report it? Did we find it ourselves?\n\n*   \"No we saw alarms but no one knows yet, support team is doing these manually\"\n\n**2\\. Assess impact**: How many have failed?\n\n*   \"A few, we've seen it earlier this morning, we think it might be AWS or they might be one-offs\"\n\n**3\\. Establish precise language:** A few is not a number, earlier is not a timestamp. Did you check the AWS status page?\n\n*   \"Just messaged support team. Checking AWS status now...\"\n*   \"AWS status is ✅ ✅ ✅\"\n\n**4\\. Identify patterns**: Are they all failing the same way? What is the error signature?\n\n*   \"Its _random_, some of them timed out after **_random_** time, some have errors **randomly**.\"\n\n**5\\. Analyze chain of events**: What did we change last?\n\n*   \"Nothing, the last deployment was two weeks ago\"\n\nThe nuances in this last question is that a lot happens outside of the standard change management process. Some of these off-the-record/alternative-record things covered in triage include:\n\n*   Configuration changes made to toggle features\n*   New users introduced never before seen behaviors\n*   Off-cycle hot-fixes deployed from feature branches\n\nThese three, plus the normal sprint work is at best recorded into only four different systems of record. Each of the systems is almost certainly the best tool for its job and each probably even has excellent integration capabilities. Unfortunately, the four are integrated manually in excel by four different people producing out-of-sync csv exports.\n\n**6\\. Initiate holy crusade**: Some of the worst atrocities committed against software get to production under the guise of hot-fixes. The perpetrators must be identified.  \n\n*   \"We should call in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, I think they were on the last incident call\"\n\n‍\n\nThis continues as more participants join the call - until - even though AWS status page is still showing ✅✅✅, someone announces:\n\n### **\"Some people on twitter are saying AWS is having an outage in us-east-1\"**\n\n_If you get nothing else out of this article - please walk away with this: If_ _you are having doubts about the status of AWS, check twitter._\n\n**This is good news.**\n\nWhile numerous system failure notifications are signaling that **shit is hitting the fan**, the mood on the call improves briefly as all are absolved of any potential guilt, its no ones fault.\n\n**Disaster** 🔥\n===============\n\nThis calm is short lived, the customers have been notified. They've escalated pissed-ness from `CRITICAL` to `SHOWSTOPPER` (from the resting baseline of `URGENT`). They are asking for an ETA on the resolution and hourly updates on the status.\n\nLarge organizations have _Recovery Time Objective (RTO)_ and _Recovery Point Objective (RPO)_ standards for disaster/outage scenarios. RTO/RPO can be internal standards or sometimes compliance requirements. What RPO/RTO actually means is best illustrated with an example:\n\n_If you're playing a video game - a crash is a disaster. The time it takes to boot the game back up is the recovery time. When the game starts back up, you've lost some progress time and have to start from an earlier autosave - thats the recovery point._\n\nThe goal is to have systems in place to maintain business continuity by reducing data loss and minimizing downtime for end users. This is done by deploying redundant infrastructure and data backups in alternate locations since physical infrastructure is geographically vulnerable.\n\nRecovery Strategy\n=================\n\nThe org's AWS technical account manager tries to reassure everyone by confirming that issue is **only regional**. Having seen an amazing disaster recovery demo from the tech team six months ago, an executive on the call, feeling like they're about to save the day asks:\n\n*   `\"We built DR capability. Why can't we recover to east-2?\"\n\nThis is where we discover that DR capability is different from a DR demo proving that failover is possible. Software changes over time. If there is an expectation that the application has recovery capability, each change must be made with the consideration for how it will behave in failure scenarios. To be clear - not try/except wrapping some new code for some feature - but how will the system with this new code and feature behave when infrastructure around it starts to break. **Adopting DR is a culture change that goes beyond the developer.** Maintaining availability requires continuous overhead in time and effort on development, management and architecture.\n\nThe answer is to this question is as usual -\n\n*   \"We could try it but we're not sure what would happen, we have to ask the devops lead, but they're out today.\"\n\nThe contributing factors to this lack of confidence come from those same nuances of the `What did we change last?` question.\n\nWhen the devops lead is finally located. They remember that something has changed since the DR demo. The recovery process has changed and someone has to write an additional script. They explain the functionality briefly but unfortunately they can't do it. They have \"a hard stop\" and have \"to drop\" to watch their pets and children on their day off.  They will then hand-off to you.\n\n35 highly paid managers on the call that are normally skeptical of pair programming -  become an engaged operating theater audience to a couple of developers [hacking together a script](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/write-shitty-code) that will never make it to version control.\n\nWhen the script is finally written, **a decision must be made.**\n\n\"Ok should we run it?\"\n======================\n\nThe story has had a number of twists so far. It was determined that the original recovery plan is out of date and had to be duct taped back together. The plan's original creators have given their warnings and **someone new must own the success or failure of the recovery**. The decision should be made with caution of course, and so, the risks need to be discussed.\n\nQA will list the environments they would like the script to be tested in, the business execs will bring up the need to work together on this with other organizational units. A few more people will join the call for a final per-hour burn rate approaching a developer’s monthly salary.\n\n**AWS will inevitably fix us-east-1, and very probably before the discussion concludes.** Someone will interrupt to announce:\n\n*   \"We're seeing less failures, looks like we're good!\"\n\nEveryone congratulates everyone on their hard work. The tech team sees a bright and hopeful future. They vow to bring this up in the post-mortem as an indisputable argument to [convince product to finally pay down the tech debt](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/we-sound-like-idiots-when-we-talk-about-technical-debt).\n\n‍\n\n⚠️ **Educational content**\n==========================\n\nThere are multiple [very well documented strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-i-strategies-for-recovery-in-the-cloud/) and architecture patterns to achieving recovery objectives.

This is meant as a companion, to help better communicate, to our non-professional colleagues, what we mean when we say \"technical debt\".\n\n‍  \n\nAs a software professional for almost 20 years (do I get a watch or plaque soon?) I've had more passionate discussions about technical debt than any other topic. It is right up there with the iconic 3rd rail topics: Tabs-v-Spaces, Mac-v-Windows, Java-v-Python and type systems.\n\n  \n\nFrom all these passionate discussions and online comments I have distilled a taxonomy of the dimensions of debt. All these types of debt at their core describe a trade off in time. Meaning they have a now vs later quality. What makes a reasoned discussion difficult is that they trade different quantities (mostly unmeasured) of different units across time with different potential probabilities of happening.\n\n  \n\nThis is what a decision of technical debt could sound like applied to a non-software example. You take your car into the shop since the check engine light came on. The mechanic finds a slow leak in the radiator and offers you the following choices:\n\n*   do nothing, risking totaling the car if the engine over heats\n*   have it resolved in 15 mins for $25, by adding coolant, then $25 every month going forward, otherwise #badthingshappen\n*   have it patched by end of day for $150 but then be back in the same position if/when the patch fails\n*   have it replaced for $300 but your car will be in the shop for a week for parts to be ordered\n\n  \n\n#### So which is the best solution? Which do you pick?\n\n  \n\nWell, that is impossible to answer. There is no right answer.\n\n  \n\nIn this example it depends on:\n\n*   your expected rate of some future events (how long will patch last? will leak get worse?)\n*   your need for the car to be working now (are you leaving on road trip vacation tomorrow?)\n*   your expected amount of future use of the car (are you planning to sell the car soon?)\n*   your bank account balance? (do you have any money?)\n*   your expected future cash flows (do you get paid next friday?)\n*   cost to borrow money (how much does your credit card charge?)\n\n  \n\nIt is trivial to construct a scenario where the \"obvious\" choice would be any one of those options. The dimensions of the choice are:\n\n*   amount of money now vs later\n*   time till the car is working\n*   expected usage of the car in the future\n\n  \n\nBelow is my attempt to at least describe and name the dimensions of technical debt akin to naming technical design patterns. If you think I missed a type or mischaracterized a type please tell me on twitter: [@seekayel](https://twitter.com/seekayel)\n\n  \n\nDimensions of Debt\n==================\n\nChange time cost\n----------------\n\nCost:\n\n*   Any future changes take more time.\n\n  \n\nHow you will hear it described:\n\n*   If we want to make changes later we will first have to undue this work\n*   Next time we will first have to do x, y, z before we can make a change\n*   This will make unscheduled Project ABC that we want harder\n*   This is brittle and is more likely to break on the next change (increased error rate)\n*   On boarding/teaching new people is harder\n*   This is a tax on future changes\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n*   Bad credit score - all future borrowing will be more expensive\n*   Currency wide inflation/devaluation - all future consumption becomes more expensive (assuming you are on a fixed income)\n\n  \n\nRuntime cost\n------------\n\nCost:\n\n*   Fixed cost in time per unit of time (eg 2hrs per week)\n*   Fixed cost in time per unit of system usage (eg 1hr per 1,000 user signups)\n\n  \n\nHow you will hear it described:\n\n*   We have to spend X hours of support per week\n*   20% of our staff hours works on escalations\n\n  \n\nFinancial Translations\n\n*   Interest only loan - will need to continue to pay until you pay off principle\n*   Selling/Buying insurance\n\n  \n\nOpportunity Cost\n----------------\n\nCost:\n\n*   Whole sets of features aren't considered or built due to existing code/system/design\n\n  \n\nHow you will hear it described:\n\n*   We don't build X or Y\n*   We don't measure/report on X or Y\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n*   Sunk cost fallacy\n*   Do you transition the same factory from producing lower value product to higher value product\n*   Career transition: forgo income, training/education expense, moving costs for future income\n\n  \n\nInterpretation:\n\nThis can be confused with the argument that actions aren't taken because the cost is too high. The focus here should be on the Opportunity that is missed. What could be but isn't, instead of the cost of what is.\n\n  \n  \n\nOrganizational Risk  \n\n----------------------\n\nCost:\n\n*   The organization assumes: financial, reputational, operational or recruiting/retention risk.\n\n  \n\nHow it is described:\n\n*   If X happens we will have to spend Y days scrambling to fix\n*   If it breaks we will have an outage\n*   If it breaks we will have a PR disaster/go out of business\n*   If it breaks we will be open to legal liability\n*   If it breaks we will have a security incident\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n*   Selling uncovered puts\n*   Selling uncovered calls\n*   Uninsured against fire/flood/earthquake\n*   Forgivable 0% interest only loan, but potential for demand payment\n\n  \n\nInterpretation:\n\nThis can be considered a compound dimension. It could include both the probability that the potential risk occurs along with the probable distribution of potential outcomes. For maximum clarity of communication I would suggest this dimension be discussed as the range of severity of the outcome, if the potential risk comes to pass.\n\n‍\n\n  \n\nMoney Cost  \n\n-------------\n\nCost:\n\n*   The organization pays more money aka US Dollars ($) than is strictly necessary.\n\n  \n\nHow it is described:\n\n*   The servers are too \"big\"\n*   The clusters aren't sized \"right\"\n*   We need to optimize process X for less memory\n*   We need to archive some/all of our data/logs\n*   We need to turn off things are aren't using\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n*   That gym membership that still is charged to your card each month even though you don't go.\n\n  \n\nInterpretation:\n\nThis is pretty straight forward, everyone in the organization understands dollars as a unit of cost. Where this is becomes more complicated is in the tradeoffs for any change with: how long it will take, what risk the organization assumes implementing it and the project coordination time to ensure one team's waste isn't another teams KPI.\n\n‍\n\nPostscript  \n\n=============\n\nAs a business person you will probably be more concerned about Opportunity Cost and Organizational Risk than Runtime Cost or Change Time Cost.

Hopefully this will help you understand what I didn’t.\n\n‍\n\nThe VC business model\n=====================\n\n‍\n\nVenture funds are companies. Their purpose for existence is to make money from making investments in other companies.\n\n‍\n\nThey are composed of Limited Partners (LPs) and a General Partner (GP). The GP is the company owned and run by the \"VC\" you meet at some networking event. The VC has formed these companies and raised money from LPs. Part of the structure of the fund is that it will exist for no more than 10 years.

The \"Limited\" in LP refers to the time the investor doesn’t spend working in the business. They send a check and that is their involvement.\n\n‍\n\nThe VC formed the GP and raised money from the LPs because they want to make money. The GP charges a management fee of 2% per year on assets the LP invests with the fund.\n\n‍\n\nThe GP will charge carry, aka 20% of any profits from the investments they make. The LPs get to first recover their initial investment, including those 2% fees, then any additional profits are shared with the GP.\n\n‍\n\nThe Lifecycle of a single VC fund\n=================================\n\n‍\n\nJust as VC funds have standard structures and standard fees, they have a standard development and lifecycle. Understanding where a particular fund is in this progression will help you understand their expected behavior. Also, a single VC might have multiple funds that are in different stages of this trajectory. I have found that VCs are very open and willing to talk about which fund they are actively investing out of, how big it is, when they raised it and their average check size. I have always been able to find this information by asking.\n\n‍\n\nFirst Years: Load up the Plate\n------------------------------\n\n‍\n\nAs a new entrepreneur I didn't realize how critical time fit with a VC was. After they raise from their investors (LPs) they are on a time crunch to get the money invested. They want to invest in good companies but they only have about 1-3 years to invest. This means it is much easier to raise from a VC who has just raised. They are rapidly putting money to work. They just arrived at the buffet with an empty plate. Everything looks good and they don't have anything that is a better alternative already on their plate.\n\n‍\n\nMiddle Years: Getting Picky\n---------------------------\n\n‍\n\nAfter that first phase they transition into a slower but still active investment role. In this 4-6 year middle window a VC will still take meetings but are much less likely to make new investments. At this phase they have a full plate but are still wandering around the buffet looking for great options. The threshold is now higher for inclusion. They may prefer the truffle parm fries they just found (your company), but they already have cajun curly fries which are almost as good (a company they already invested in). However they may have raised a new fund so they could be in two phases at once - make sure to ask!\n\n‍\n\nThese VCs won't tell you that they probably won't invest. They are happy to ask questions and probe into your business. They get tremendous market intelligence from taking these meetings. They get to see:\n\n*   What people are pitching (deal flow)\n\n*   How is the market is responding to these pitches?\n\n*   Do you raise quickly? Do you struggle to raise? At what price?

What are your churn rates?\n\n*   Potential insights for their current portfolio companies\n\n*   Optionality of investing in an amazing company/founder eg maybe your company is the best investment they have seen in their professional life\n\n‍\n\nFinal Years the Tail End: Finishing up\n--------------------------------------\n\n‍\n\nAt this point they have transitioned to harvesting or running off the portfolio. They are returning funds to investors. They know that their investment fund will close after 7-10 years so this is a period of actively winding down.\n\n‍\n\nAt the buffet they have switched to dessert and coffee. It would be an extraordinary turn of events such that you could convince them to take a scoop of some new main course.

So effectively that VC is \"loading their plate\" even if one of their funds is in this phase of winding down.\n\n‍\n\nOutcome Fit\n===========\n\n‍\n\nA natural tendency when considering an endeavor (business or other) is to start with the likelihood of success. This line of thinking asks how probable each outcome is. It is a frame of thinking that trades size of outcome for certainty in outcome. Increasing certainty can raise the floor on returns, but also lower the ceiling.\n\n‍\n\nWhen the VC was raising money from LPs they put together a spreadsheet that described the basic economics of the venture fund. Roughly it modeled the following for 10 investments:\n\n*   5 will fail completely, the investments will be a complete loss\n\n*   3 will do ok, they will each return somewhere between 3x\n\n*   1 will do great, it will return 10x\n\n*   1 will do amazing, it will return 25x+\n\n‍\n\nThis would put the fund in the top-1% of VCs. A more likely outcome of those 10 investments is:\n\n*   6 will fail\n*   3 will do ok they will each return on average ~3x\n*   1 will do great, it will return ~5x\n\n‍\n\nThis would put the VC roughly at the median returns for all VC firms. You can read more over at this [great break down of VC returns](https://www.toptal.com/finance/venture-capital-consultants/venture-capital-portfolio-strategy#strike-outs-dont-matter-in-vc).\n\n‍\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/625dd037e0bac549cf18edf9_venture-returns-sethlevine.png)\n\nDistribution of Returns on VC Investments (credit: [Seth Levine](https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html))\n\n‍\n\nLet us step back and look at your company from the VC's perspective for a moment. They are evaluating if your company has the potential of returning 10-50x the investment they make. Only if the company passes that screen will they engage on if your company has a reasonable risk adjusted chance of making that outcome a reality.\n\n‍\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\n‍\n\nThe tech twitter joke of \"big if true\" can be a helpful tldr guide for how VCs evaluate potential investments. Make sure you know where they are in their investing lifecycle to ensure you are spending your time wisely. Hopefully this was helpful.

What is it costing us?  \n\n**Techie**: Oh, it’s not that. What I’m saying is the code doesn’t use best practices, there are alot of things hard coded and lots of spaghetti code. It makes the code really brittle.  \n\n**Business person**: But can we still deliver what we promised to Big Co Inc?  \n\n**Techie**: Yes, but we will have to do some workarounds. Working on the system is painful and what could have been a one day job will instead take a week. We really need to refactor!\n\n**Business person**: Ah. That's good news. Our number one priority right now is Big Co Inc.\n\n  \n\n**Conclusion**: You don’t like your job because it is hard and/or annoying. Will tell your dev manager to ask you to work on the weekend.\n\n  \n\n### Talking with Business Leaders\n\n  \n\nWhen we use the term technical debt with non-technical business colleagues, they assume, that technical debt is analogous to financial debt. After a few minutes of discussion they are usually relieved to find that there is no actual money problem. Then after not seeing any tangible sign of a fire in the movie theater, they will then conclude that that we either don’t know what we are talking about or we are using the wrong terms or both.  Think about their context, how quickly would the CFO get fired if they claimed \"we have a lot of debt\" but couldn’t produce a balance sheet with lenders, amounts, interest rates and terms?\n\n  \n\n> how quickly would the CFO get fired if they claimed \"we have a lot of debt\" but couldn’t produce a balance sheet\n\n‍\n\nIn this unprepared conversation we miss a great opportunity to convince that business leader of a course of action we are proposing or to engage in a productive trade-off discussion about risk, investment and priorities. Instead we reinforce the business leader’s view that we may know about software but we don’t know about business, and that we shouldn’t be making decisions about priority. \n\n‍\n\n> Instead we reinforce the business leader’s view that we may know about software but we don’t know about business\n\n  \n\nIn this staged conversation, what we communicated was that technical debt made our job hard and annoying. Notice it did not communicate: an inventory of debt, the ongoing cost to the business and the investment needed to pay it off.\n\n  \n\n### How to Fix It\n\n  \n\nCompanies and business leaders don’t care if jobs are hard or annoying or take longer than they \"should\". The difference between a user story taking a day or 3 days is negligible compared to its business value. Companies and their leaders care about revenue and costs. They care about customers and growth. They care about time to market. If we want to have our non-technical colleagues listen and act, we need to either improve our use of the financial terms they understand or we need to translate our message into business outcomes that they do care about.\n\n‍  \n\n> business leaders don’t care if jobs are hard or annoying or take longer than they \"should\" ... we need to translate our message into business outcomes that they do care about\n\n‍  \n\nTo capture these opportunities we need to go back to the beginning. The only way to remedy these failures in communication is to refactor our language and use of terms. We need to better define technical debt and the terms we use to describe it. The use of units of dollars is a powerful tool to communicate to those not part of the software design, build, and run value stream. Let's start with how the non-technical listener will understand the terms of debt.\n\n‍  \n\n> using a unit of dollars is a powerful tool to communicate to those not part of building software\n\n‍\n\n### What is Financial Debt?\n\n  \n\n**Debt** is a contractual agreement that allows the **borrower** to to shift future **consumption** into the present. This also allows the **lender** to do the reverse, shift present consumption into the future. The amount of consumption that is shifted is the **principal**. The amount that is still due at any point of time is the **balance**. The cost per unit of shifted consumption is the **interest rate**. The distance through time that the consumption is shifted is the **term** of the debt. The frequency and amount that is paid to service the debt is the **payment schedule**. All of these terms should be familiar to most consumers who have a mortgage, credit cards or a car loan.\n\n  \n\nNotice that there is no judgment or statement if debt is good (**productive**) or bad (**unproductive**). If you use debt to purchase a house, is that good or bad? That question can only be answered in the context of the cost of that debt (**interest rate**) and if you are changing your monthly consumption on housing. If your mortgage payment is less than your current rent then it is probably good debt. By borrowing money you have lowered your monthly expenses. This is a productive use of debt.\n\n  \n\nThis view of debt is much more inline with how companies reason about their debt. The primary questions are:\n\n1.  What is the cost of the debt?\n2.  What additional value will the debt buy?\n3.  What is the expected change to cash flow from this investment?\n\n  \n\nBorrowing money to build a bigger factory that will enable more efficient production of your products is probably a productive use of debt. Borrowing to fund bonuses for executives is probably unproductive.\n\n  \n  \n\n### A Different Conversation\n\n  \n\nIf we use these terms to communicate the technical debt we are holding as a team the communication could look like this.\n\n  \n\n**Techie**: Oof, we had to give discounts that amounted to 1% of our sales again last month.  \n\n**Business person**: Yeah but what can we do about it?  \n\n**Techie**: Well, our order system is filled with technical debt. We can either keep paying with the discounts for the failed orders, or we can invest in 3-6 weeks of engineering time to half the error rate. This could delay other features.  \n\n**Business person**: If you can half the error rate we can afford to hire more engineers.\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/we-sound-like-idiots-when-we-talk-about-technical-debt","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1660313773847},"$loki":17},{"slug":"why-i-started-cyclic","title":"Why I Started Cyclic","summary":"Choosing to start a company is a combination of an analytical and subjective decision.
