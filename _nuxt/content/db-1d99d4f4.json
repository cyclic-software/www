More on the round later. Multiple founder friends have asked about my experience and why I used an RUV. Here is the Why, What and How:\n\n  \n\n**TL;DR**\n=========\n\n  \n\n> A Roll Up Vehicle is a legal entity that can take investments from multiple investors or entities and then invest that money as a single entity on your company’s cap table. Here are the pros and cons for using an AngelList RUV as part of a venture capital fundraising round:\n\n‍  \n\n![](/content/61034dd64ba727b1f9120503_angellist_ruv.png)\n\nVisual depiction of how investments are rolled up onto your captable\n\n**Pros**:\n---------\n\n*   Future rounds are simplified, exactly when most stressful\n*   Future rounds are cheaper ($)\n*   Investor's address and info is kept private\n*   Simplified e-signature and funding for investors and company at time of investment\n\n###   \n\n**Cons**:\n---------\n\n*   Some additional setup for the company (~1hr)\n*   Small additional cost (now only filing fees https://www.angellist.com/blog/eliminating-fees-for-roll-up-vehicles)\n*   Additional complexity describing to your investor who AngelList is and how they are involved\n\n  \n  \n\n### **Should I use a RUV?**\n\n  \n\nI would definitely recommend an AngelList RUV to anyone raising an early venture capital round where:\n\n  \n\n*   You expect to raise another round in the future \n\n  \n\nAnd one or more of these to apply:\n\n  \n\n*   You have 10 or more angels\n*   You have angels that do less than 4 deals a year\n*   You have angels writing checks for less than $25k\n\n  \n  \n\n### **Cyclic - What we do**\n\n  \n\nAs a developer the complexity to go from your local to the cloud is increasing. This is driving cloud platform selection into a pre-design time decision. We are dedicated to solving both of these problems for developers. Our goal is to let you push to deploy while making cloud environment selection a runtime decision. Sign up for the [Cyclic Private Beta](https://app.cyclic.sh/api/login)  \n‍\n<a href=\"https://deploy.cyclic.sh/cyclic-software/starter-express-api\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://deploy.cyclic.sh/button.svg\" />\n</a>\n\n\n### **My Past Experience**\n\nAt the last company I co-founded, we raised a convertible note and then two priced rounds over the course of 7 years. The deal terms were reasonably standard for VC deals. They included drag along provisions. We were first time founders and I think we did an \"ok\" job of keeping all of our investors updated on how the company was doing.\n\nDespite drag along rights (i.e. company able to \"drag\" small investors into a transaction if some percentage of shares in the company agree to the transaction), the lawyers involved with our second priced round wanted signed docs from all investors along with consent of spouse docs for any investment held by a person instead of trust or other entity. This meant that we needed to coordinate outreach to roughly ten angel investors, most of whom were non-professional angels. We needed to bring them up to speed on why we were raising, and explain we needed their signatures on documents for the round even though the company had drag along rights. Oh and by the way, we needed signatures from their spouses as well, leading them to have the same conversation with less fidelity with their spouse.\n\n  \n\nThe more experienced angels who had larger checks generally understood the process and were more likely to have entities which they used to make the original investment. So they were either less likely to have questions and most were able to be a sole signer on behalf of the entity that held the investment. The converse of this was also true. The smaller check angels were more likely to have questions, they were less familiar with what was standard and they were more likely to need signatures from a spouse. Additionally, it seemed that the less experienced angels were less engaged with email and had longer turn around times.\n\n  \n\nIn a vacuum, handling  each of these conversations is manageable. However, once a closing date was set,  all of these small \"punch list\" items seemed to bubble to the surface. It seemed that there was a spike in the length of items remaining once the date was set. The 7 to 14 days before closing are among the most stressful for a co-founder. In my experience, having extra tasks and communication on my plate was extra stress at exactly the wrong time.\n\n  \n\n> The 7 to 14 days before closing are among the most stressful for a co-founder... having extra tasks and communication on my plate was extra stress at exactly the wrong time.\n\n  \n\n### **Why an RUV**\n\n  \n\nThe RUV prevents the need to keep going back to the early angels. It is a legal structure where the angels have already agreed that someone designed by the RUV organizer will be able to sign future docs related to their investment. The designated person can sign any future fundraising documents. In my case, I am that designated signer.\n\n  \n\nThis means at the next funding round I will be able to sign on behalf of the RUV. So for a bit more time and cost upfront (and maybe a bit more complex conversation with the angels) I am able to decrease my complexity (and stress) at the time of each future funding round.\n\n  \n  \n\n### **How it works for Founders**\n\n  \n\nSign up and on-boarding were easy. I wrote a blurb on the company, uploaded a deck or memo, filled in some deal terms, identified notable co/lead-investors, targeted raise amount, and selected how I would pay the RUV fee (either company pays or investors pay). I didn’t have the exact form of the SAFE complete when I set up the RUV, it is only required at close, provided it is substantially the same terms as any of the listed co/lead investors.\n\n  \n\nFor me there was some email back and forth with the AngelList team since they were still doing a staged rollout when I signed up. I had some questions during setup and emailed with two people who work at AngelList. Both were responsive and helpful. The email support felt personal and attentive.\n\n  \n\nMy only complaints on the company product side are that the UI/UX was a bit complicated for just doing the RUV. It seemed it was more focused on syndicates and funds. If there is any \"product\" work for the AngelList team this is probably where it is. For example: to get to the RUV page you navigate via the \"Deals\" menu item and the deal is listed under my \"Syndicate\". This all sorta makes sense given the product is essentially a Syndicate where the fee and carry are 0%. However it doesn’t really make sense when I am the company founder doing a RUV.

The flow has e-signature to the RUV docs and the ability to enter bank account details so AngelList can initiate an ACH (electronic transfer).

The constraint drove engineers and architects to decide what they would and would not store at design time. Rigid data models and schemas were put in place.

You can now grow your MVP to enterprise scale and all the things are taken care of for you.\n‍\n\nNow, AWS Kinesis can dump [half a million](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html) (soft limit) records per second into an S3 bucket. If you don't know where to find half a million of records per second, a handy menu of [channel partners](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/integrations/) is available on the console. They are ready to pipe it to you with only a few clicks_. (But don’t worry, versioning is probably enabled on your bucket and some runaway recursive ghost code is endlessly touching some config file.)_\n\nThe NDJSON is flowing, data scientists are on-boarded and life is really great for a while, until one day; at one of the many many status meetings the leadership points out that your group has **burned through the cloud budget for the year, and it is only May**. In cost explorer, the trickle from multiple firehoses has accumulated into an S3 storage bill of almost $100k/month. \n\n> ... the trickle from multiple firehoses has accumulated into an **S3 storage bill of almost $100k/month**.\n\nThis **sounds like a disaster**, but it's not the end of the world, right? At least the problem is measurable. And after all, you can just delete a bunch of objects and move a bunch of the remaining junk to AWS Glacier (or whatever they just changed the name to).**‍**\n\n### **Or can you?**\n\n##### **‍**⚠️ Documentation References Ahead ⚠️\n\nS3 objects are named by their Bucket and Prefix - For the S3 objects :\n\n```\ns3://my-bucket-us-east-2/app/events/login-123123.json  \ns3://my-bucket-us-east-2/app/events/logout-436564.json\n```\n\nThe json files named `login-123123.json` and `logout-436564.json` are not actually in a folder called events nested in another called app.\n\nThe files are stored on a physical drive somewhere and indexed someplace else by the entire string `app/events/` - called the prefix. The `/` character is really just a rendered delimiter. You can actually specify [whatever you want](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html) to be the delimiter for list/scan apis. \n\nAnyway, under the hood, these prefixes are used to shard and partition data in S3 buckets across whatever wires and metal boxes in physical data centers. Since any character can be a delimiter, this actually happens over time as AWS discovers the access patterns for the data. This is important because while AWS will adapt to any pattern - the prefix design drives access patterns for human developers and impacts performance in large scale high volume read and write applications.\n\nThe limits on reads and writes are:\n\n* 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests per second per prefix\n* 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix  \n\nThis means you can make up to 3500 write / 5500 read requests per second to add or look at `app/events/` files. Higher than that, and you may experience `503` or `429` errors, especially with burst traffic.  \n\nWhen faced with the challenge of producing or accessing big data with practical performance - [Best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html), enterprise support, and your technical account manager (TAM) will recommend that you:\n\n> ... use an object key naming pattern that distributes your objects across multiple prefixes.  \n\n### Tech debt\n\nThese best practices are usually overlooked in early MVPs and objects are likely stored with the familiar `folder/file` pattern. It doesn't take long for the issue to expose itself. The first performance issues are usually experienced on read when someone first tries large scale queries with tools like AWS Athena and competes with the customer-facing processes for S3 reads.  \n\nThis is chalked up as a [repaying tech-debt](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/we-sound-like-idiots-when-we-talk-about-technical-debt) and work is done to adapt the existing patterns to best practices. Processes that used to produce `app/events/login-123123.json` are refactored to write `app/events/dt=yyyy-mm-dd/login-123123.json` instead. (Actually something like app/events/dt=yyyy-mm-dd/asdfasdfasdf.gz , building crawler schema to make parquet out of messy, dynamic json files is hard and you think you're smart and just enable gzip compression in firehose.)\n\n**Cool.** You configure the partition key `dt=yyyy-mm-dd` in the data catalog, write some documentation about how everyone should use date ranges to make queries efficient. All is well and the data science team can again do linear regressions aka \"Machine Learning\" to find out which events make the most money or, you know \"drive business kpis\".\n\n### Back to our original problem\n\nSome time has passed and **you now have a shitload of data in S3**. Someone has noticed how much it costs and **now you have to clean it up**.  \n\nHopefully, AWS is holding your hand on this one - you're a really great customer obviously. They will tell you, the two options you have to clean stuff up are:\n\n* **Delete objects one by one** manually by using the list and delete API’s _(yeah, sounds dumb)_\n* **Set up lifecycle policies** at the bucket level to expire objects based on prefix rules _(this sounds promising!!)_\n\nLifecycle policies are pretty great.\n\nThey work by first specifying a filter like:\n\n* Apply by tag _(That would be sweet.. but no one tagged any of the objects that are already in there)_\n* Apply by a size threshold _(There is no meaningful size difference between stuff you might want or not want)_\n* Apply by prefix _(Yeeeah, that's the one)_\n\nThen specifying a rule like:\n\n* Expire after some time has passed\n* Move to a different storage class\n* Delete older versions of objects\n\n### Stop the bleeding  \n\nWithout much research, the prefix filter thing looks really good. Naturally, as it is with filters, everyone would need to decide what they want to keep and not keep.  That sounds like a mess of calls and meetings. On that dilemma, the (actually good) advice from your partners at AWS\n\n> \"Your costs are accumulating, we can help you move the really old stuff to Glacier to stop the bleeding.\"  \n> ‍- Some AWS bro\n\nThere are obvious tradeoffs with Glacier. But since large scale reads, especially ones on old data are not often done, after some short all-hands discussions everyone agrees.\n\n### The 100 thousand dollar button  \n\nYou go back and press the button in the console. A message comes up asking you to confirm that you are aware that:\n\n![](/content/620d170b68d74639eb4fe9f1.png)\n\nBut isn't there like a million billion objects?? How about a different storage class?  [Requests & data retrievals](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) > Lifecycle Transition requests into (per 1,000 requests). Even though the s3 console does not produce the ominous warning when selecting other storage classes, [transitional request charges apply](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html). **Fuuuuuuuuu  \n‍**  \nDoing metrics inventory with some help from AWS on your billions of json files and a little math - it is determined that **pressing this button will incur a one time cost of around $100,000**.\n\nVery few people (all non-technical) in the organization have the ability to authorize this. No one (or at least not the mere mortals) wants to be the one to give those people this news. There goes Plan A. On to plan B: Figure out what can be deleted.\n  \nBefore this gets escalated, you rush to set up meetings with stakeholders. Data science says keep all the logins but don’t care about logouts. The application team needs both but only for a week or so. Compliance says some things can be archived but archives must be kept for a year.  Complicated, but for now there is something to say at the status meetings - \"We're working on it.\"  \n\n> \"We're working on it.\"\n>\n> \\- everyone in every status meeting ever\n\n### Lifecycle policies are not magic\n\nFast forward through three months of weekly status meetings, working with different teams to document data retention requirements. Yes, the bills were paid, more stuff has been stored and costs have risen, but - **there is finally a list!**\n\nYou will archive the logouts after 30 days and delete after a year for compliance, logins will be kept for 6 months for the data science team, archived... etc. etc.\n\n‍\n\n**Now here is the twist.** Somehow over many meetings, AWS support calls, etc - the story of how prefix filters work has morphed into how everyone wanted it to work.  Checking back in with support - you find out that `app/events/\\*/login-\\*.json` and `app/events/\\*/logout-\\*.json` is not actually going to magically scan wildcard patterns. It's the flip side of the partitioning coin. **The thing that makes reads and writes so performant makes it impossible to implement wildcards in lifecycle policies.**\n\nHow did everyone come to the misunderstanding? (well other than by not reading the docs) Could it be coming across [similar language in docs for a different AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/policies-object-lifecycle-components.html) that does have wildcards? Skimming over [blog posts](http://www.deplication.net/2019/02/aws-tip-wildcard-characters-in-s3.html) on the subject? The [S3 docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html) not telling you explicitly that you can't do that? _(Comments welcome)_  \n\n### The Truth\n\nFaced with this truth, the heroes realize that a lot of time has been put into crafting those rules, lists were made, arguments were had. There is no going back to Plan A now. A few sprints later - developer gets a user story: **Use big-ass SageMaker to crawl s3 and clean up** _(3 points._ \n  \nWhether or not the org is still paying that bill has been lost to history but legend says that user story got de-prioritized.\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/aws-s3-why-sometimes-you-should-press-the-100k-dollar-button","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283665760},"$loki":8},{"slug":"aws-tools-suck","title":"AWS Tools Suck","summary":"If you have ever worked with AWS as a developer then you will know what I mean, AWS tools suck.

You sign in with Github and you are ready to hit deploy.\n\nYeah, go for it! We’re cheering you on. 🎉\n\nHowever, depending on how your app is configured, there are a few speed bumps you might hit before your build is running smoothly. Keep reading to be prepared and get over those speedbumps for a smooth deploy!\n\n\n\n### Speed bump #1: No more nodemon\n\nIt's generally considered best practice to used the npm module [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) during development because it watches for file changes as you are working. However nodemon isn't needed in production.\n\nIf you are using nodemon to run your app locally, you’ll need to update the start script that tells Cyclic how to run the application before you deploy your app. \n\nLuckily for you, Cyclic will scan your repository before the build starts and provide you with a message to this effect.

Cyclic can see the variables you've used in your project and will give you a little push to add them the moment your build is complete.\n\n![](/content/varswarning.bumps.png)\n\nIf that message doesn't catch you, you’ll be able to see under the “Logs” tab that your application isn’t communicating with your database or any other errors that missing vars would bring, such as something being \"undefined\" or \"not a string\". Time to add those vars in the “Variables” tab. \n\nThere are already some variables in there, like your pre-populated Cyclic URL. All you have to do is add any additional variables in using the key/value pairing at the bottom.\n\n![](/content/varswithcircle.bumps.png)\n\nRemember the key should match the key in your code, and if you want to copy/paste from your .env file, be sure to try out the bulk editor tab.\n\n![](/content/bulkeditor.bumps.png)\n\nOnce the variables are all set, check your logs again. Oh yeah, now we’re cooking with gas.\n\n\n### Speed bump #3: MongoDB\n\nBuilds using MondgoDB are very popular and run great on Cyclic, but there’s one catch… Because Cyclic is serverless, requests to MongdoDB need to be written in a certain order so they are heard correctly. \n\nOur docs have an excellent example of how to structure your MongoClient and mongoose, if you are using it. Check it out here: [https://docs.cyclic.sh/how-to/using-mongo-db](https://docs.cyclic.sh/how-to/using-mongo-db)\n\nTLDR? You have to connect to MongoDB before your code starts to listen for requests, otherwise they may be missed entirely. \n\nOnce you’ve updated your MongoClient code, you should be seeing all 200s in the logs. \n\n![](/content/allgreenlogs.bumps.png)\n\nSpeed bumps traversed! That site is live. Quick, share it with all your friends!\n\nAre you finding other speedbumps? Let us know and we’ll do our best to help you over them. \n\nCheck out our Discord community to ask questions and share your creations: [discord.cyclic.sh](https://discord.gg/RbX73p5P)\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/common-mistakes-for-first-time-deploy","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283665785},"$loki":10},{"slug":"considerations-for-serverless-active-active-routing","title":"Considerations for Serverless Active-Active: Routing","summary":"Building active-active in multiple regions can be expensive and complex.

It will greet people and apply ＦＡＮＣＹ text effects.\n\nYou’ll be writing code using the Typescript language and running it on the Node.js server environment.\n\nAnd seeing as Telegram bots are built on an HTTP-based API, you’ll be using the [GrammY framework](https://grammy.dev/) for higher-level abstractions and a better programming experience.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore writing any code, make sure to have the following programs installed on your computer:\n* [Telegram client.](https://telegram.org/)\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14+, NPM v6+, and cURL.\n* VS Code, or any other IDE of choice.\n\nYou’ll be using [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/) to host this project on the cloud, so make sure to take advantage of the Free Forever tier.\n\nAnd while you don’t have to be an expert in it, you should know a bit of Typescript. You’ll be using it to write all the code in this tutorial.\n\n### Setup the Project\n\nDownloading the starter files\nStart-up this project by cloning the final version into your computer:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/eludadev/telegram-bot.git\ncd telegram-bot\n```\n\nAnd make sure to roll it back to its very first stage, so you can learn how to build the rest of it in this tutorial:\n\n```bash\ngit reset --hard 3ea99a5e111e84da4825b0732d76c386b5c8fdda\n```\n\nAfter that’s done, install the project’s dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n#### Getting your Telegram bot API token\n![](/content/botfather.access.gif)\n\nUsing the Telegram client, start a conversation with the [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather). \n\nSend it the following messages:\n1. /newbot\n2. Your bot name\n3. Your bot username (can’t contain spaces and must end in “bot”)\n\nAfter that, create a new file in the project’s root directory called `.env`. Paste the following line into that file, replacing `<YOUR-API-TOKEN>` with your bot’s API token that you just got from the last message with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).\n```text\nTELEGRAM_TOKEN=<YOUR-API-TOKEN>\n```\n\n#### Initializing the Telegram bot\nCreate a new file called `bot.ts` in the `src/` directory. That’s where you’ll be writing code for the rest of this tutorial.\n\nYou’ll be using the [GrammY framework](https://grammy.dev/) to build this bot; it’s much easier this way instead of interacting directly with the [API routes](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).\n\nHead into the bot script and import the library in question:\n```typescript\nimport { Bot } from \"grammy\";\n\n// Create a bot using the Telegram token\nconst bot = new Bot(process.env.TELEGRAM_TOKEN || \"\");\n```\n\nAs you can see, the bot is created with the `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` variable that you just set in the `.env` file. After that, handle all message events by responding with a friendly robot introduction:\n```typescript\nconst introductionMessage = `Hello! I'm a Telegram bot.\nI'm powered by Cyclic, the next-generation serverless computing platform.\n\n<b>Commands</b>\n/yo - Be greeted by me\n/effect [text] - Show a keyboard to apply text effects to [text]`;\n\nconst replyWithIntro = (ctx: any) =>\n  ctx.reply(introductionMessage, {\n    parse_mode: \"HTML\",\n  });\n\nbot.on(\"message\", replyWithIntro);\n```\n\nTake note of the `parse_mode` parameter. It’s used to allow HTML tags in the message response, such as `<b>Commands</b>`.\n\nAnd finally, start-up the bot by running one method:\n```typescript\nbot.start()\n```\n\nFollow that by executing the bot script:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n![](/content/botfather.newbot.png)\n\nAnd boom! You’ve got yourself a dead-simple bot running on your computer. You can test-it out by sending it a message on Telegram; you may want to follow the link previously given to you by [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).\n\n## Handle basic commands\n![](/content/botcommands.basic.gif)\nTelegram bots can handle commands, which aren’t much different from ordinary messages. The syntax for such interactions follows the following format:\n\n```typescript\nbot.command(\"start\", replyWithIntro);\n```\n\nTest it out by sending the `/start` message to your bot. Note that your program is automatically updated once you modify the bot script.\n\n\nAfter that’s done, modify your bot to handle the `/yo` command. It will simply respond with the username of the sender:\n```typescript\n// Handle the /yo command to greet the user\nbot.command(\"yo\", (ctx) => ctx.reply(`Yo ${ctx.from?.username}`));\n```\n\nAnd since the `bot.on(“message”)` event handler is on top, it will catch all messages and the /start and /yo commands won’t have an effect. Please make sure to always keep it at the bottom of the file:\n\n```typescript\n// Keep this at the bottom of the file\nbot.on(\"message\", replyWithIntro);\n```\n\n## Build Inline Keyboards\nTelegram bots can also respond with a set of buttons underneath the message.\nLet’s do a simple demonstration. Change the introductory response to also contain a button that links users to the [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/) website, the platform that we’ll use to deploy our bot to the cloud for free at the end of this tutorial:\n\n```typescript\nimport { InlineKeyboard } from \"grammy\";\n\nconst aboutUrlKeyboard = new InlineKeyboard().url(\n  \"Host your own bot for free.\",\n  \"https://cyclic.sh/\"\n);\n\nconst replyWithIntro = (ctx: any) =>\n  ctx.reply(introductionMessage, {\n    reply_markup: aboutUrlKeyboard,\n    parse_mode: \"HTML\",\n  });\n```\n\nAfter this step, you may want to re-execute the bot script after interrupting it with the `Ctrl+C` keyboard combination:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n#### A more advanced example\n![](/content/advancedcommands.bot.gif)\nLet’s now do a more advanced example. Other inline keyboards may contain general buttons, whose actions can be handled to the furthest extent.\nHandle the `/effect`command, and make it apply bold, italic, and a bunch more effects to text:\n\n```typescript\nimport { chunk } from \"lodash\";\nimport { applyTextEffect, Variant } from \"./textEffects\";\n\nimport type { Variant as TextEffectVariant } from \"./textEffects\";\n\ntype Effect = { code: TextEffectVariant; label: string };\nconst allEffects: Effect[] = [\n  {\n    code: \"w\",\n    label: \"Monospace\",\n  },\n  {\n    code: \"b\",\n    label: \"Bold\",\n  },\n  {\n    code: \"i\",\n    label: \"Italic\",\n  },\n  {\n    code: \"d\",\n    label: \"Doublestruck\",\n  },\n  {\n    code: \"o\",\n    label: \"Circled\",\n  },\n  {\n    code: \"q\",\n    label: \"Squared\",\n  },\n];\n\nconst effectCallbackCodeAccessor = (effectCode: TextEffectVariant) =>\n  `effect-${effectCode}`;\n\nconst effectsKeyboardAccessor = (effectCodes: string[]) => {\n  const effectsAccessor = (effectCodes: string[]) =>\n    effectCodes.map((code) =>\n      allEffects.find((effect) => effect.code === code)\n    );\n  const effects = effectsAccessor(effectCodes);\n\n  const keyboard = new InlineKeyboard();\n  const chunkedEffects = chunk(effects, 3);\n  for (const effectsChunk of chunkedEffects) {\n    for (const effect of effectsChunk) {\n      effect &&\n        keyboard.text(effect.label, effectCallbackCodeAccessor(effect.code));\n    }\n    keyboard.row();\n  }\n\n  return keyboard;\n};\n\nconst textEffectResponseAccessor = (\n  originalText: string,\n  modifiedText?: string\n) =>\n  `Original: ${originalText}` +\n  (modifiedText ? `\\nModified: ${modifiedText}` : \"\");\n\nconst parseTextEffectResponse = (\n  response: string\n): {\n  originalText: string;\n  modifiedText?: string;\n} => {\n  const originalText = (response.match(/Original: (.*)/) as any)[1];\n  const modifiedTextMatch = response.match(/Modified: (.*)/);\n\n  let modifiedText;\n  if (modifiedTextMatch) modifiedText = modifiedTextMatch[1];\n\n  if (!modifiedTextMatch) return { originalText };\n  else return { originalText, modifiedText };\n};\n\n// Handle the /effect command to apply text effects using an inline keyboard\nbot.command(\"effect\", (ctx) =>\n  ctx.reply(textEffectResponseAccessor(ctx.match), {\n    reply_markup: effectsKeyboardAccessor(\n      allEffects.map((effect) => effect.code)\n    ),\n  })\n);\n\n// Handle text effects from the effect keyboard\nfor (const effect of allEffects) {\n  const allEffectCodes = allEffects.map((effect) => effect.code);\n\n  bot.callbackQuery(effectCallbackCodeAccessor(effect.code), async (ctx) => {\n    const { originalText } = parseTextEffectResponse(ctx.msg?.text || \"\");\n    const modifiedText = applyTextEffect(originalText, effect.code);\n\n    await ctx.editMessageText(\n      textEffectResponseAccessor(originalText, modifiedText),\n      {\n        reply_markup: effectsKeyboardAccessor(\n          allEffectCodes.filter((code) => code !== effect.code)\n        ),\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Handle Inline Queries\n![](/content/inlinequeries.bot.gif)\n\nTelegram bots support inline queries, a feature which enables them to be invoked from any chat within Telegram by calling them with their “@” username. Let’s use this to allow users to apply text effects in any conversation using your bot.\n\n#### Enabling inline mode for your Telegram bot\n![](/content/enableinlinemode.bot.gif)\n\nBy default, this feature comes disabled. Contact [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) to enable it:\n1. /mybots\n2. Select your bot from the inline keyboard\n3. Bot settings\n4. Inline mode\n5. Turn on\n\nHandling the “effect” inline query\nInline queries are generally handled by matching a RegEx pattern. We’ll listen for the “effect [effect] [text]” query and handle it by applying [effect] to [text]:\n\n```typescript\nconst queryRegEx = /effect (monospace|bold|italic) (.*)/;\nbot.inlineQuery(queryRegEx, async (ctx) => {\n  const fullQuery = ctx.inlineQuery.query;\n  const fullQueryMatch = fullQuery.match(queryRegEx);\n  if (!fullQueryMatch) return;\n\n  const effectLabel = fullQueryMatch[1];\n  const originalText = fullQueryMatch[2];\n\n  const effectCode = allEffects.find(\n    (effect) => effect.label.toLowerCase() === effectLabel.toLowerCase()\n  )?.code;\n  const modifiedText = applyTextEffect(originalText, effectCode as Variant);\n\n  await ctx.answerInlineQuery(\n    [\n      {\n        type: \"article\",\n        id: \"text-effect\",\n        title: \"Text Effects\",\n        input_message_content: {\n          message_text: `Original: ${originalText}\nModified: ${modifiedText}`,\n          parse_mode: \"HTML\",\n        },\n        reply_markup: new InlineKeyboard().switchInline(\"Share\", fullQuery),\n        url: \"http://t.me/EludaDevSmarterBot\",\n        description: \"Create stylish Unicode text, all within Telegram.\",\n      },\n    ],\n    { cache_time: 30 * 24 * 3600 } // one month in seconds\n  );\n});\n```\n\n## Polish the Telegram Bot\n![](/content/polishthebot.png)\n\nIt’s often useful for Telegram bots to display a list of supported commands, and while we’re already doing that in the introductory message, there’s a more formal way of doing so, and it’s as simple as one command:\n\n```typescript\n// Suggest commands in the menu\nbot.api.setMyCommands([\n  { command: \"yo\", description: \"Be greeted by the bot\" },\n  {\n    command: \"effect\",\n    description: \"Apply text effects on the text. (usage: /effect [text])\",\n  },\n]);\n```\n\nNote that to see the new menu, you must restart your Telegram client.\n\nFurthermore, professional bots come with a profile picture and a well-formed description. You can do all of that by contacting [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather):\n1. Edit bot\n2. Edit about / Edit description / Edit botpic\n\n## Deploy the Telegram Bot to the Cloud\n\n#### Long Polling vs Webhooks\nThere are two fundamentally different ways of deploying your Telegram bot to the web.\n\nThe first one is [Long Polling](https://grammy.dev/guide/deployment-types.html#how-does-long-polling-work), and we’ve already been using it in this tutorial by running `bot.start()`. With it, bots constantly send requests to the Telegram servers checking for new messages, and responding to them accordingly.\n\nThis approach is not compatible with the serverless architecture, as the latter expects applications to only run once, and only on-demand.\n\n“Serverless means applications are only on for the time it takes to process individual requests. They are suspended immediately after each response is sent.” — [Cyclic docs](https://docs.cyclic.sh/serverless/on-demand).\n\nThe solution to this problem is deployment by [Webhooks](https://grammy.dev/guide/deployment-types.html#how-do-webhooks-work), an alternative strategy that makes the Telegram client itself contact your bot when there’s a new message. And while this comes with [its own drawbacks](https://grammy.dev/guide/deployment-types.html#webhook-reply), it’s fully compatible with serverless architecture.\n\n#### Using Webhooks for deployment\nBy following the `NODE_ENV` environment variable, we can tell whether the bot instance is running in a development or a production stage. Replace the `bot.start()` command with the following:\n\n```typescript\nimport { webhookCallback } from \"grammy\";\nimport express from \"express\";\n\n// Start the server\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\") {\n  // Use Webhooks for the production server\n  const app = express();\n  app.use(express.json());\n  app.use(webhookCallback(bot, \"express\"));\n\n  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n  app.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Bot listening on port ${PORT}`);\n  });\n} else {\n  // Use Long Polling for development\n  bot.start();\n}\n```\n\n#### Pushing all files to a Github Repository\nIt’s imperative that we use a Github repository to store our bot files so we can deploy it to the cloud. After [creating a new repository](https://github.com/new) (either public or private), run the following commands to link it with your local Git instance, replacing `<YOUR-GH-REPO-LINK>` with your repo’s URL:\n\n```bash\nexport GH_REPO=\"<YOUR-GH-REPO-LINK>\"\ngit remote remove origin\ngit remote add origin \"$GH_REPO.git\"\n```\n\nAfter that, stage, commit, and push your files to the new remote origin:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Build the Telegram bot.\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n#### Deploying for free using Cyclic\nAfter creating your Cyclic account, use it to deploy your new Telegram bot.\nIt’s free forever, and no credit card is required.\n\nNote that you must sign up using the same Github account that you used to create your bot’s repository.\n\n![](/content/deploywithcyclic.bot.gif)\n\nOpen your [Cyclic dashboard](https://app.cyclic.sh/#/), click on the Deploy button and switch to the “Link your own” tab. Search for your bot’s repo and click on the “Connect” button. Then sit back and watch it do all the work for you!\n\n![](/content/editvariables.bot.gif)\n\nThe final step is setting the same environment variables as you did in the `.env` file. Open your Cyclic deployment’s dashboard page, switch to the Variables page and set the appropriate values for the environment variables:\n- NODE_ENV: production\n- TELEGRAM_TOKEN: your bot’s API token (same as `.env` file)\n\n#### Connecting your Telegram bot to your Cyclic server\n\n![](/content/connecttelegram.png)\n\nYou want to tell Telegram to send the Webhook requests to your Cyclic server. So conclude this project by copying your Cyclic deployment’s URL and running these commands:\n\n```bash\nexport TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=... # YOUR TELEGRAM API TOKEN\nexport TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=... # YOUR CYCLIC DEPLOYMENT URL\n\ncurl \"https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN/setWebhook?url=$TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL\"\n```\n\nAnd boom! Your bot’s now actively running on the cloud! You may stop your local development instance by pressing `Ctrl+C` and notice how your bot is still working.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nYou’ve successfully reached the end of this tutorial! There are many more things you could add to this bot, including but not limited to games, error handling and internationalization.\n\nYou may also want to learn more about Telegram bots:\n* [https://grammy.dev/guide/inline-queries.html](https://grammy.dev/guide/inline-queries.html)\n* [https://grammy.dev/plugins/keyboard.html](https://grammy.dev/plugins/keyboard.html)\n* [https://grammy.dev/guide/deployment-types.html](https://grammy.dev/guide/deployment-types.html)\n\nAnd here are some resources to advance your knowledge about serverless computing:\n* [Cyclic vs Heroku](https://www.cyclic.sh/vs-heroku)\n* [Considerations for Serverless Active-Active: Routing](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/considerations-for-serverless-active-active-routing/)\n* [How to Fail at Serverless: Serverless is Stateless](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/how-to-fail-at-serverless-serverless-is-stateless/)\n* [Creating and Deploying a RESTful API on Serverless Infrastructure](https://docs.cyclic.sh/tutorials/rest-api-and-dynamodb/part-1)\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/how-to-build-a-telegram-bot","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283665967},"$loki":13},{"slug":"how-to-debug","title":"How to Debug","summary":"We all hit bugs that feel impossible to diagnose.

The hardest ones to debug are intermittent or inconsistent. How do I fix what works sometimes? If a line of code always breaks then the fix is direct. The system is linear. The action leads to a failure.\n\n‍\n\nHow do I debug a bug that is intermittent? How do I debug something that works sometimes?\n\n‍\n\nHere are some reminders to myself next time I encounter a baffling debugging session.\n\n‍\n\nChoose Learning\n---------------\n\n‍\n\nMy greatest learnings come from debugging. This bug is an opportunity for me to learn more about this system. If I already knew what was causing the problem then I wouldn't have a bug. The fact that I have a bug that isn’t obvious to me on how to fix, by definition means I have a chance to learn.\n\n‍\n\nThe system is giving me the gift of the chance to learn.\n\n‍\n\nChoose to take the opportunity to learn.\n\n‍\n\nChase the Error\n---------------\n\n‍\n\nAnswer the question: \"how do I make this fail every single time?\"\n\n‍\n\nInstead of continuing to make the system work. Instead make the system fail. Go straight at the error. Maximize it. Increase the error rate. Trigger the error repeatedly.\n\n‍\n\nFocus on driving the error rate to 100%. Only then can I be sure any success is from my action and not inconsistency.\n\n‍\n\nMake predictions to test my understanding: \"The system will fail, now (pushes button)\"\n\n‍\n\nSimplify\n--------\n\n‍\n\nOnce I can create the error on demand, I isolate. I begin simplifying the steps to trigger. Remove steps or hard code responses. Trim excess complexity not needed to cause error.\n\n‍\n\nIf it takes 6 steps to reproduce, try turning each one off in order.\n\n‍\n\nFind the minimum degrees of freedom to still reproduce the error.\n\n‍\n\nAssess the Inverse\n------------------\n\n‍\n\nReminder: the error is not caused by something I understand. Look explicitly for areas where I assume the system is working.\n\n‍\n\nWhat are the parts of the system that I am sure are working? What if they weren’t working as I expected? Verify the components are actually working as I expect.\n\n‍\n\nReminder: It’s not what we don’t know that gets us into trouble, it is what we know for sure that isn't true\n\n‍\n\nDevise a Conclusive Measure\n---------------------------\n\n‍\n\nBrainstorm what report, measure, logging or data would definitely tell me what is causing the error. Maybe this won't tell me \"why\" the error is happening, but point me closer to \"where\" the error is being caused.\n\n‍\n\nQuestion: What piece of information would conclusively tell me what the problem was?\n\n‍\n\nTake a Break\n------------\n\n‍\n\nI might be making things worse. If I don’t know what causes the error I don’t know if I’m making it worse. If the situation allows for it, take a break.\n\n‍\n\nGet some air. Go for a walk. Breath.\n\n‍\n\nA clear relaxed mind is open for new ideas.\n\n‍\n\nSleep on it. Pick it up tomorrow.\n\n‍\n\nExplain How to Reproduce\n------------------------\n\n‍\n\nSay it out loud.\n\nTalk to myself.\n\nExplain the steps to reproduce.\n\nStart at the beginning.\n\nBack up three steps and explain again.\n\nSlower this time.\n\n‍\n\nSummary\n-------\n\n‍\n\nHopefully this helps you debug an issue you are struggling with. If you have other techniques or improvements to these let me know: twitter.com/seekayel\n\n‍\n\nFor those who jump to the end, here is the tldr:\n\n‍\n\n1.  Choose Learning\n2.  Chase the Error\n3.  Simplify\n4.  Assess the Inverse\n5.  Devise a Conclusive Measure\n6.  Take a Break\n7.

Re-running the step function in production succeeds.\n\n‍\n\n![](/content/62c866a26c2399e457733a1f_lambda-pac-man.png)\n\nlambda pac man loves eating data and leaving it in /tmp\n\n  \n\n  \n\n### **Solution**\n\n  \n\nWell... lambda instances have a writable `/tmp` folder where you can store temporary files. And somewhere in the AWS docs they describe how instances of your Lambda function are reused between invocations.\n\n  \n\nSome quick googling gets you a solution of clearing `/tmp` at the start and/or end of each invocation ([stack overflow ftw](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44108712/aws-lambda-release-tmp-storage-after-each-execution)). Till that fix makes it to production you can just re-execute any failed step function runs.\n\n  \n\nNothing quite like shipping code copy-pasted from Stack Overflow. Nice.\n\n  \n\nSuccess! Party!  \n\n![](/content/62c867cdc310db14bbac6405_leo-congrats.gif)\n\nStack Overflow code FTW!\n\n  \n\n‍\n\nuntil... wait what? out of memory errors? WTF!\n\n  \n\n### **Problem v2**\n\n  \n\nPeriodically a step function run fails. The Lambda invoke error is no memory left (or similar depending on os and language). Running the same file in dev/test doesn't reproduce the error. Re-running the step function in production succeeds. Turning on debug or releasing new builds adding additional logging suppress the error rate. WTF (why the failure?) Load tests don't reproduce the error.\n\n  \n\nThe explanation that AWS just fails on 1 in ~100k lambda invokes starts to wear thin with your Ops team that is getting paged to click a button. But we could just automate the re-run!\n\n  \n\nDeep inside accepting it \"just fails\" violates some axiom about how computers works. This is knowable and damn-it I shall know. So you strap the lambda down setting max concurrency to 1. Turn up the load test. Let’s do this.\n\n  \n\nAt 12k documents the lambda invoke fails for out of memory. Interesting.\n\n  \n\nRerun the load test. At 12k documents the lambda invoke fails for out of memory.\n\n  \n\nIf an error is repeatable it isn't random. 12k is an important number. It also happens to be the maximum number of file descriptors allowed for the linux OS the lambda is running on.\n\n  \n\nBack to google. Apparently the image manipulation library I am using has a history of bugs with leaving open file descriptors. Looks like each invoke to lambda is leaving another file descriptor open in the OS file descriptor table.\n\n  \n\nThe lambda will then fail when it hits 12k unless it is recycled. The lambda instance can be recycled due to:\n\n* a code deployment: new code, new instances\n* update to environment variable: hence why turning on debugging suppressed errors.\n* scaling down: a burst in load will scale out new instances and then scale back down. Only some instances survive.\n\n  \n\n### Solution v2\n\nExpand the IAM role permissions to allow the lambda permission to update itself (your security team might give you side eye for this, fair warning, send them this blog post, I'm sure it will convince them).\n\nAfter completing the work of an invoke, call the lambda api to set an environment variable to a random value. We dubbed this the \"self-immolation\" solution.\n\n![](/content/62c868256c23997e757361fa_lambda-self-immolation.png)\n\nThis lambda will self destruct in 3... 2... 1...\n\nHacky? Yeah.\n\nChaos for the lambda team? Probably.\n  \n### YOLO 🤷  \n\nDid it work? Yes.\n\nStay tuned, for more stories of #fail.\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/how-to-fail-at-serverless-serverless-is-stateless","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283666030},"$loki":15},{"slug":"how-to-get-your-first-developer-job","title":"How to Get Your First Developer Job","summary":"This post will improve your odds.

I think of acquiring and growing a group of users differently based on the scale of the existing user base. There is a great book that talks about going 0 to 1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero\\_to\\_One). What I mean here is how to go from 0 users to 1 user.\n\n  \n\nIn this case the first user is ... You.\n\n‍\n\n> Use your product before you launch.  \n\n‍\n\nYou are the first user. Use your product before you launch. Every day. Selling meal kits? Well you eat every day don't you? There are very few startups where you can't be trying the product prior to launch on a daily or weekly basis.\n\n  \n\nThe absolute best would be to go through the full onboarding process as a new user. Sometimes that is impractical. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good here. Daily is better than weekly, weekly is better than monthly. Set yourself a recurring meeting for an hour weekly.\n\n‍\n\n> Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good\n\n  \n\nRight after college I worked for an online bank. I insisted that I be an account holder. And I used the account. This didn’t immediately make me exactly like the other users of the site, but it gave me a grasp of the feel of the product.\n\n  \n\nWhen I was a cofounder of a citizen engagement service, I didn't use the platform daily and I think it showed. I wasn't immersed in the experience of being a user. I was external, guessing what users might want.\n\n  \n\nNow at Cyclic I try to push code everyday. The best days are when I build a new starter example and try to deploy for the first time.

And you probably dealt with [the \"framework dilemma\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ux2ov8/how_do_you_guys_determine_which_frameworks_to_use/) at some point in your career.\n\nSome of us pursue React, the [most popular framework](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-webframe-want). And that's completely understandable, because it being famous also implies that it's the most demanded skill in the job market.\n\nNext up is Vue, and its second position in the popularity spectrum. Some people prefer Vue for the fact that it's so lightweight and yet so scalable, and others love its simplicity and similarity to other frameworks.\n\n![](/content/62d6d1173d02703377a9cef3_top-liked-frameworks.png)\n\nLet's take a leap of faith and change our selection criteria from popularity to likability.\n\nSvelte is the most loved framework, and for good reason. Svelte places strong emphasis on developer happiness because it's so easy to pick up and has a compiler that is more efficient than its peers.\n\nI always wondered how different it would be to build the **same app** with the same features, but in **3 different frameworks**. For each one, I want to answer the following questions:\n\n- How many errors will I encounter?\n- How much code is there to write?\n- How long does it take to build?\n\nWe'll be exploring each of the aforementioned frameworks in its own piece, as part of a four-article series.\n\nWe'll build a [website for publicly sharing short-messages, called **\"ithink\"**](https://ithink.cyclic.app/). It's like Twitter, but with no accounts and you can't delete what you post.\n\n‍<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"gOerqjg\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/gOerqjg\">\n  It's Twitter, but you can't delete.</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nBut first, we need an API\n-------------------------\n\nIf you play around with the CodePen above, you'll quickly realize that the database is not fake.\n\nWe actually have a [back-end side of our application](https://github.com/ithink-corp/api): it handles the storing and retrieving of simple text data. It's also built on [Amazon's S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) object storage service.\n\nA developer would normally spend hours and hours setting-up a database like this, and it's not free either.\n\nLuckily for us, we get a free instance of the AWS S3 Storage when we [use Cyclic](https://app.cyclic.sh/). No credit card is required.\n\n[![https://deploy.cyclic.app/button.svg](/content/62d6cf389192e7f60cbda7b0_button.svg)](https://deploy.cyclic.sh/ithink-corp/api)\n\n‍\n\nVue, the lightweight framework\n------------------------------\n\nLet's start by exploring the wonders of Vue, the framework that [claims itself to be one of the most performant frontend frameworks](https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html#is-vue-fast).\n\n### Creating a new project\n\nIt's no secret that setup is one of the most important stages in a project's lifecycle. It's the very first step in the journey that transforms an idea into a real-life, working application that runs on a modern computer.\n\nWe can all agree that creating a boilerplate from scratch is exhausting. I mean, think about all the folders, files, and code that you'd need to keep repeating, forever. No one wants to do all that work!\n\nLuckily, Vue does all the work for us when we run the following command:\n\n`npm init vue@latest`\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions so you can create the optimal setup that best fits your project. So go ahead, and accept/reject the following questions:\n\n- Project name: **ithink**\n- TypeScript? **No**\n- JSX Support? **No**\n- Vue Router? **No**\n- Pinia? **Yes**\n- Vitest? **No**\n- Cypress? **No**\n- ESLint? **No**\n- Prettier? **No**\n\nWe'll see what each of these means throughout this article.\n\nNext up is installation. This time, you don't have to do anything. Just kick-back, relax, and wait for `yarn` to do its work! (of course, you can also use `npm` if that's your preference)\n\n```sh\ncd ithink\nyarn install # or npm install\n```\n\n\n‍<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"oNqxVBY\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/oNqxVBY\">\n  vue-0</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nThis command will create a dead-simple boilerplate which comes with some defaults. Go ahead and run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` and open up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. It's already looking great, isn't it?\n\nYou'll see a semi-usable application describing Vue, with the addition of some links to its inner-workings.\n\nUnfortunately, most of this stuff is useless to us. Therefore, we'll erase most of it so that we can continue along this guide:\n\nTake some time to observe the folder structure. Notice the emphasis that it places on [decoupling](https://jamstack.org/glossary/decoupling/). Everything is where it's supposed to be, making it a very clean and elegant architecture to work on.\n\n```\ntree .\n├── index.html\n├── package.json\n├── public\n│   └── favicon.ico\n├── README.md\n├── src\n│   ├── App.vue\n│   ├── components\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.js\n│   └── stores\n├── vite.config.js\n└── yarn.lock\n```\n\nDon't worry if this looks intimidating. We'll cover _all of it_ throughout this document.\n\n### Configuring SEO\n\nYou might have noticed that the title of our document is _\"Vite App\"_, with no immediately obvious way of changing it.\n\nIt turns out that this is a great opportunity for us to delve into the first element: `index.html`. You've undoubtedly already seen this filename in a billion other places, but probably not in the context of Vue.\n\nSo let's dive into `index.html`, and update some defaults:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n    - <title>Vite App</title>\n    + <title>ithink</title>\n    + <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Global online messaging, void of any borders.\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWe changed the title and added a description. Hence, quite simply, index.html is the entry-point to our application. It's where you modify the `<head>` meta-tags, add class-names to the top-most elements such as `<body>` and `<html>`, and change the language of your website from English (\"en\") to say, French (\"fr\").\n\nIt's also impossible to avoid speaking about `<div id=\"app\"></div>`. As we'll see in an upcoming section, this is where all-things-Vue are injected. So let's keep on exploring!\n\n### Changing the body color\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"BarKMEw\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/BarKMEw\">\n  vue-1</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>‍\n\nThe website we're building has an overall dark theme, meaning that the `<body>` color should be changed from white to dark.\n\nAfter [configuring TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), we'll start adding these changes to our document.\n\nYou must've already created a `src/index.css` file during your Tailwind configuration, and imported it from `src/main.js`. So, let's add our custom styles:\n\n```css\n/* index.css */\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind utilities;\n@tailwind components;\n\nbody {\n  @apply bg-stone-900;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we're using the `@apply` directive to _apply_ the `bg-stone-900` utility to the body. If you're not very Tailwind-savvy, `bg-stone-900` is equivalent to the following CSS declaration:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    background: #1c1917;\n}\n```\n‍\n\n### Adding a header\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"qBoZvrN\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/qBoZvrN\">\n  vue-2</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nIt's time to delve into our second-most element: App.vue. It's the top-most component of our application.\n\nWhatever you put inside this file will go straight into `<div id=\"app\"></div>`. Remember it? We mentioned it in the last paragraph of the section that covered `index.html`. See how it all fits together? Magical!\n\n![](/content/62e02ea8cb6f0b99cc5ba095_hierarchy.png)\n\nAnd with all that said, let's implement our overly-simplistic header:\n\n```html\n<template>\n    <!-- App.vue -->\n    <header>\n        <h1>ithink</h1>\n        <button>New</button>\n    </header>\n</template>\n```\n\nAs you can see, we kept it pretty simply.\n\nHey! I hid the Tailwind class-names from the code snipped above. Browse our code repository to see the full code.\n\n**_Ahem_**_,_ let's address the elephant in the room. What the heck is `<template>`?\n\n* Before we get into that, let me explain a fundamental concept to you.. **Web components!**\n* Web components give developers the ability to create their own tags:\n* `<profile-card>`, `<emoji>`, `<close-button>`, `<code-editor>`\n* **_It's like magic!_** You get to encapsulate your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web components are an elegant way to create user-interfaces that resemble native apps. They're the future of the web.\n* If this sounds cool to you, you're probably wondering how to create these things.\n\nSo let me introduce… **Single File Components!** (SFCs)\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    // Javascript here\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <!-- HTML here -->\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n    /* CSS here */\n</style>\n```\n\nAs you can see, SFCs split a component's design into three logical parts, and they can come in any order:\n\n- **JavaScript logic:** (`<script setup>`) The brains of your component. Handles state, events, networking, etc…\n- **HTML document:** (`<template>`) The semantics of your component.\n- **CSS declarations:** (`<style scoped>`) The style of your component.\n\nPretty neat, huh?\n\n### Listening to click events\n\nAs it currently stands, the \"new\" button doesn't do anything, and no one wants a useless button.\n\nSo let's change that! We must listen to a click event, and [in Vue, events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html) work like this:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    function openModal() {\n        // TODO\n        alert('button clicked!')\n    }\n</script>\n<template>\n    <button @click=\"openModal\">New</button>\n</template>\n```\n\nWe'll come back to the openModal function later, when we actually create the modal!\n\n### Creating a modal component\n\nIt's time to put the src/components folder to good use. This is where we'll be housing all our custom components.\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"VwXaRbb\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/VwXaRbb\">\n  vue-3</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nWhat you can see in the image above is the \"New Modal\" component, written into the NewModal.vue file.\n\nCreate a new file at `src/components/NewModal.vue`. Fill it up with the usual SFC boilerplate:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    // NewModal.vue\n</script>\n\n<template>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n</style>\n```\n\nLet's get the markup out of the way: (remember to use [the right semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics))\n\n```html\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <dialog open>\n      <main>\n        <form method=\"dialog\">\n            <label for=\"content\">Content</label>\n            <textarea id=\"content\"></textarea>\n\n            <button value=\"cancel\">Cancel</button>\n            <button value=\"default\">Post</button>\n        </form>\n      </main>\n      <footer>\n        <p>Whatever you write will become public.</p>\n      </footer>\n    </dialog>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nMarkup alone is not very useful without the JavaScript logic. Let's attach event handlers to our button elements:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    function close() {\n        // TODO\n    }\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    ...\n    <button value=\"cancel\" @click=\"close\">Cancel</button>\n    <button value=\"default\">Post</button>\n    ...\n</template>\n```\n\n‍\n\nOkay, this is great! But notice that when you click on \"post\", the page reloads. This is the default [behavior of HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form).\n\nNormally, we'd change that by calling `e.preventDefault`. But Vue focuses so much on simplicity that there's a super-convenient shortcut:\n\n‍\n```html\n<script setup>\n    function submit() {\n        // TODO\n    }\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    ...\n    <form method=\"dialog\" @submit.prevent=\"submit\">\n        ...\n    </form>\n    ...\n</template>\n```\n\nWould you look at that! We're able to shorten e.preventDefault() to @submit.prevent. Now, we don't even need to consider [the Event object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) anymore!\n\n### Tracking a loading state\n\nThe user should know when their application is loading, whether it's posting new text to the server or just retrieving it.\n\nLet's create a variable that tracks when our component is sending/receiving data to/from the server. We're gonna be using [reactive variables](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html).\n\n‍\n\nWhat is a **reactive variable**?\n\n- Consider the following scenario:\n\n```javascript\nlet a = 4\ndocument.getElementById('container').textContent = a // <p id=\"container\">4</p>\n```\n\n- Say that we updated the value in a to 5. One thing we know for sure is that the `<p>` element won't change. It will always say \"4\", unless we explicitly change it.\n- Well, we don't have to! With [reactivity](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html), the DOM is automatically updated once the related variable is mutated.\n- In Vue, reactive variables are created with ref, a function that takes any value and makes it reactive.\n\n```javascript\n‍import { ref } from 'vue'\nconst a = ref(4)\na.value = 5\n```\n\n- Notice the addition of .value. It's important, because if we did a = 5 we'd completely taking away the reactivity of the variable.\n- Also, it doesn't matter that a is a constant variable, because we're only assigning to its .value property.\n- Now look at the HTML:\n\n```html\n‍<template>\n    <p>{{ a }}</p>\n</template>\n```\n\n- Vue will replace {{ a }} with its value: a.value, and the double-brackets are _not_ optional.\n\nOkay, let's head right back into the submit logic. We'll create a new isLoading reactive variable, which will indicate when our app is in-contact with the server.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isLoading = ref(false)\nasync function submit() {\n    isLoading.value = true\n\n    // TODO: send data to server\n\n    isLoading.value = false\n}\n```\n\n### Getting user input from form elements\n\nOur \"new modal\" component can't exist without the `<textarea>` form element. But this raises an important question: _how do we keep the javascript code in-sync with the DOM content?_\n\nIn a nutshell, Vue has a shortcut way of dealing with form elements. And it's quite convenient!\n\nAs you can see, message is a reactive variable, so whenever the user types something into textarea, message will be instantly updated. That's the magic of v-model!\n\nHey! You may be getting tired from typing .value all the time. Thankfully, Vue has plans to change that.\n\n### Making the modal inert while loading\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"QWmNogz\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/QWmNogz\">\n  vue-4</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nWhen our app is loading (which is tracked by the isLoading variable that we saw in a previous section), we should disable interaction with it.\n\nThis requires us getting access to a DOM element in JavaScript. The pure way of doing that is with body.querySelector(), but this approach is non-reactive. Plus, there's a simpler alternative offered by Vue:\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n    const container = ref(null)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <div ref=\"container\"></div>\n</template>\n```\n\nThese are called [template refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html)! And although it says null, Vue will fill container with the DOM element <div ref=\"container\"> when it's created. It will also go back to null when it disappears.\n\nWith this in hand, we can make our component inert while it's loading:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n    const container = ref(null)\n\n    async function submit() {\n        isLoading.value = true;\n        dialog.value.setAttribute(\"inert\", true);\n\n        // TODO: send data to server\n\n        dialog.value.removeAttribute(\"inert\");\n        isLoading.value = false;\n    }\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <div ref=\"container\"></div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\ndialog[inert] {\n  @apply filter brightness-90;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nHey! While there's a simpler way to achieve the above (`<div :inert=\"isLoading\">`), I just had to create an opportunity to teach you about template refs, which are a pretty important feature in VueJS.\n\n### Automatically focusing the `<textarea>`\n\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"ExEKMQK\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/ExEKMQK\">\n  vue-5</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nWhen the user opens the NewModal component, we know that their objective is to input into the `<textarea>`. So, wouldn't it be convenient to save them the hassle of moving the cursor towards that form element?\n\nLet's implement this feature! Counter-intuitively, we can't do this:\n\n```html\n<h1>blah blah</h1>\n<script setup>\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n    const textarea = ref(null)\n\n    textarea.value.focus() // this is WRONG!\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <textarea ref=\"textarea\"></textarea>\n</template>\n```\n\nThe above code won't work, because it's the same as saying null.focus().\n\nSo, how do we tell Vue to only focus the textarea once it's available? The answer lies in [**lifecycle hooks**](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html).\n\n![](/content/62e02ecd52420b19a8e6d301_lifecycle.png)\n\nWe want to utilize the \"mounted\" hook, which is called right after the component is added to the DOM. That's when the `<textarea>` is shown, meaning that it's not null:\n\n```javascript\nimport { onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nonMounted(() => {\n    textarea.value.focus() // CORRECT! :)\n})\n```\n\nThere are many more lifecycle hooks, and we usually use most of them. However, in our application, the \"mounted\" hook was more than enough. But just keep one thing in mind, you'll see this concept again and again in every framework.\n\n### Closing the modal when clicked outside\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"yLKOmKV\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/yLKOmKV\">\n  vue-6</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nIt's a pretty common behavior in every modal to close it once the user clicks outside.\n\nIn this step, we'll take a HUGE shortcut. Instead of manually implementing this behavior, we shall use another library to do it for us.\n\nThe Vue community is humongous and infinitely helpful, so it's not a surprise to find a library like [@vueuse](https://vueuse.org/functions): over 200 useful methods that cover almost every possible use–case.\n\nOur interest lies in the \\[onClickOutside event\\]([https://vueuse.org/core/onClickOutside/](https://vueuse.org/core/onClickOutside/)), which is triggered every time the user clicks outside a certain DOM element.\n\nAfter [setting up @vueuse](https://vueuse.org/guide/), let's add it to our component:\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n    import { onClickOutside } from '@vueuse/core'\n\n    // Close dialog when clicked outside\n    const container = ref(null)\n    onClickOutside(container, close)\n\n    function close() {\n        // TODO\n    }\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <dialog ref=\"container\">...</dialog>\n</template>\n```\n\nFascinating how in one line of code, we're able to implement such a seemingly complicating feature!\n\n### Closing the modal\n\nThe modal has no way of telling whether its opened or closed, as only its parent — App.vue — knows such information.\n\nBut there's one thing we know to be true, and it's that the modal knows _when_ it should be closed:\n\n- user clicked outside,\n- user submitted,\n- user canceled.\n\nTherefore, we need a way for the child — NewModal — to communicate with its parent, App. And the solution is quite simple: [Events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html)!\n\nWith Vue, it's super-simple to define our own events, while dictating when they should be emitted, using _our_ own rules.\n\n```javascript\nconst emit = defineEmits(['close'])\n\nfunction close() {\n    emit('close')\n}\n```\n\nHenceforth, whenever the modal needs to be closed, we emit the event \"close\" up into its parent.\n\nHey! Notice how we didn't import defineEmits. That's because it's a compiler macro, so it's always there by default.\n\n### Using our custom component\n\nUp until now, you couldn't see NewModal, because it hasn't been added to App.vue yet. So, let's change that:\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\n    import NewModal from './components/NewModal.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <NewModal />\n</template>\n```\n\nWith the code snippet above, the modal will always be open. So, let's add some toggle magic:\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\n    import NewModal from './components/NewModal.vue'\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n\n    const isModalOpen = ref(false)\n\n    function openModal() {\n        isModalOpen.value = true\n    }\n    function closeModal() {\n        isModalOpen.value = false\n    }\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <NewModal v-if=\"isModalOpen\" />\n</template>\n```\n\nWe took advantage of `v-if` to show/hide the modal.\n\nAnd now we're done with the NewModal component. Pretty simple, huh?\n\n### Creating a dynamic list of DOM elements\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"jOzqgpr\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/jOzqgpr\">\n  vue-7</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nIt's time to delve into a new component, ThoughtList. This one will display a list of items, and we don't know the length of that list before-hand.\n\nLet's create a new file at `src/ThoughtList.vue`. In Vue, here's how we repeat an element:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n    const items = ref(['hello', 'world!'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <ul>\n        <li v-for=\"item in items\">\n            <p>{{ item }}</p>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</template>\n```\n\nSurprisingly simple! It might be useful to split this component into two: `ThoughtList.vue` and `ThoughtItem.vue`.\n\nSo, we'll change `src/ThoughtList.vue` to:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    import { ref } from 'vue'\n    import ThoughtItem from './ThoughtItem.vue'\n\n    const items = ref(['hello', 'world!'])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <ul>\n        <li v-for=\"item in items\">\n            <ThoughtItem />\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</template>\n```\n\nand the new `ThoughtItem.vue` will contain:\n\n```html\n<template>\n  <p>\n    Hello world!\n  </p>\n</template>\n```\n\nAnd of course, don't forget to add it to `App.vue`:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\nimport ThoughtList from \"./components/ThoughtList.vue\";\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <main>\n    <ThoughtList />\n  </main>\n</template>\n```\n### Passing text from parent to child\n\nWe've seen how to trigger events from child to parent, and now, it's time to _flip_ that formula around.\n\nCurrently, our `ThoughtItem` displays the same text: \"Hello world!\"\n\nBut we want to show real data, which is held by the parent — `ThoughtList` — in the `items` reactive variable.\n\nThe solution to this problem is called **Props** (properties). They're like HTML attributes, if they could contain _anything_! (arrays, objects, and even functions!)\n\nSo let's make a little change to `ThoughtList.vue`:\n\n```html\n<template>\n    <ul>\n        <li v-for=\"item in items\">\n            <ThoughtItem :message=\"item\" />\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</template>\n```\n\nHey! It's important to add the colon : before the prop name. It tells Vue to treat the content between \"...\" as JavaScript code (the item variable), instead of a String (the text \"item\").\n\nAnd now, we can access the text message in `ThoughtItem` effortlessly:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\ndefineProps({\n  message: String, // `message` has type String.\n});\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <p>\n    {{ message }}\n  </p>\n</template>\n```\n\nHey! Just like defineEmits, defineProps is a compiler macro and doesn't require importing.\n\n### Loading data from the server\n\nUp until now, we only used mock data. So, let's change that! We'll be getting data from an external API.\n\nBut first, notice that we'll need to access our API from two separate components: ThoughtList for retrieving all items, and NewModal for adding new items to the [l](https://docs.cyclic.sh/docs/concepts/database)ist.\n\nThis is called a [shared-state](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management.html#what-is-state-management) between multiple components. There's no immediately obvious way of solving this issue, but thankfully, there's an entire library designed just for that, and it's called [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).\n\nThis is where we'll start working with the stores/ folder. So let's create the src/stores/thoughts.js file.\n\n‍\n\n![](/content/62e02ef269d01d02c0b009f1_pinia.png)\n\n‍\n\nA store should always resemble this boilerplate, so use it as a starting-point:\n\n```javascript\n// thoughts.js\nimport { defineStore } from 'pinia'\n\nexport default defineStore('thoughts', {\n    state: () => ({\n        // Reactive variables here\n    }),\n\n    actions: {\n        // Methods here\n    }\n})\n```\n\nWe created a store with the \"thoughts\" ID name.\n\nBut _what_ is a store, you may ask? It's simply a collection of reactive variables and methods that act on them:\n\n```javascript\n// thoughts.js\nimport { defineStore } from 'pinia'\n\nexport default defineStore('thoughts', {\n    state() {\n        return {\n            reactive_var: 1,\n            another_reactive_var: 'awesome!',\n            again_another_reactive_var: [0, 2, 4]\n        }\n    },\n\n    actions: {\n        my_method() {\n            // We can access all reactive variables here using `this.`\n            // NOTE: we don't have to use `.value` here!\n            this.reactive_var++\n            return this.another_reactive_var * 4.5\n        }\n    }\n})\n```\n\n\nNotice how we don't have to use .value here. Awesome!\n\nNow, let's create an actually useful store:\n\n```javascript\n// thoughts.js\nimport { defineStore } from \"pinia\";\n\nexport default defineStore(\"thoughts\", {\n  state() {\n    return {\n      items: [],\n    };\n  },\n  actions: {\n    async load() {\n      // Fetch data from the Cyclic API\n      const res = await fetch(\"https://ithink-api.cyclic.app/\", {\n        headers: {\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        },\n      });\n      const items = await res.json();\n\n      this.items = items;\n    },\n    async add(message) {\n      // Post data to the Cyclic API\n      await fetch(\"https://ithink-api.cyclic.app/\", {\n        method: \"post\",\n        headers: {\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({\n          text: message,\n        }),\n      });\n\n      this.items.unshift(message);\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAll we did here is declare an items reactive variable that will contain our most important data. We then defined the load method that should be called to load data from the server and assign it to items.\n\nWe also defined the add action, which asynchronously sends data to the server and adds it to the items list.\n\n### Using real data in our application\n\n‍<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"BarKXOy\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/BarKXOy\">\n  It's Twitter, but you can't delete.</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nLet's connect our thoughts store with our application! We'll start with NewModal:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n    import getThoughtsStore from '../stores/thoughts.js'\n\n    const { add: addItem } = getThoughtsStore()\n\n    async function submit() {\n        await addItem(message.value)\n        close()\n    }\n</script>‍\n```\n\nWe extracted the add function from the store by calling it as a function. Here, we called it getThoughtsStore, which is a convention when using Pinia.\n\nWould you believe me if I told you that was it? Well, I never lie.\n\nLet's move into ThoughtList, which will load data from the server in order to display it.\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n  import getThoughtsStore from \"../stores/thoughts\";\n  const { load: loadItems } = getThoughtsStore();\n\n  await loadItems();\n</script>\n```\n\nAnd we also have to access the items reactive variable straight from the store. So let's follow the same pattern here:\n\n```javascript\nconst { items } = getThoughtsStore(); // this is WRONG\n```\n\nBut counter-intuitively, this breaks the reactivity of the variable. Here's the right way of doing this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { storeToRefs } from \"pinia\";\nconst { items } = storeToRefs(getThoughtsStore()); // CORRECT :)\n```\n\nPerfect!\n\nNotice how in our previous code example, we're using a top-level await to load the data in ThoughtList:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n  import getThoughtsStore from \"@/stores/thoughts\";\n  const { load: loadItems } = getThoughtsStore();\n\n  await loadItems();\n</script>\n```\n\nComponents with [top-level awaits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46515764/how-can-i-use-async-await-at-the-top-level) are called **async components**.\n\nIf we leave it like this, we're gonna get the following error: (check your devtools console)\n\nComponent `<Anonymous>`: setup function returned a promise, but no `<Suspense>` boundary was found in the parent component tree. A component with async setup() must be nested in a `<Suspense>` in order to be rendered.\n\nIt's telling us that we should use a component called `<Suspense>` as a parent to the [`async component`](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async.html). [`<Suspense>`](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html) is a built-in Vue component, so we can use it anywhere in our app. Let's use it in App.vue:\n\n```html\n<script setup>\n  import ThoughtList from \"./components/ThoughtList.vue\";\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <main>\n    <Suspense>\n      <ThoughtList />\n    </Suspense>\n  </main>\n</template>\n```\n\nIt now works _perfectly_! Yay!\n\n### Adding a loading state to our list\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"gOerqjg\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/gOerqjg\">\n  It's Twitter, but you can't delete.</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nCurrently, our ThoughtList component will be invisible until data is loaded. That's inconvenient, and makes a great example of [bad UX](https://pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-loading-feedback/).\n\nThankfully, since we're already using `<Suspense>`, we can directly tell it to show something else while its child is loading. Add this to App.vue:\n\n```html\n<Suspense>\n    <ThoughtList />\n\n    <template #fallback>\n        <p>Loading...</p>\n    </template>\n</Suspense>\n```\n\nAs you can see, anything within `<template #fallback>` will be shown when ThoughtList is loading. Awesome!\n\nBut we can get even awesome-r than that. Let's show a [loading skeleton](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a)!\n\n```html\n<Suspense>\n    <ThoughtList />\n\n    <template #fallback>\n        <div class=\"flex flex-wrap gap-2\">\n            <div v-for=\"i in 15\" class=\"h-16 w-48 animate-pulse rounded bg-stone-50/10\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</Suspense>\n```\n\nYou should know that i in 15 is a shortcut that Vue offers us to loop over the range \\[1, …, 15\\]. Super!\n\nAnd with that done, our app is now **complete!** Now that wasn't so hard, was it?\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe covered a handy amount of Vue features:\n\n- [Suspense](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html) and [async components](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async.html)\n- [The @vueuse library](https://vueuse.org/functions)\n- [Reactive variables](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html)\n- [Skeleton loading](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html)\n- [Custom events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html)\n- [Lifecycle hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html)\n- [Template refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html)\n- [v-for](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html) and [v-if](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html)\n- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)\n\nSome of these are common to all web frameworks, while some aren't. We'll compare Vue with the rest of its peers at the end of this series, so I suggest you keep on reading! Trust me, there's a whole lot more to learn! 😄\n\n‍\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/i-made-the-same-app-3-times-in-3-different-frameworks-heres-what-i-learned","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283666284},"$loki":19},{"slug":"its-always-sunny-in-us-east-1","title":"Its Always Sunny in us-east-1: The gang does business continuity","summary":"The gang experiences an AWS outage; customers report SHOWSTOPPERs; the gang triages the issues and attempts to implement an elaborate disaster recovery plan","colId":"60d0f077b69e2df6b324616c","id":"623b2c46371050340e82e69e","createdAt":"2022-03-23T14:18:46.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-19T13:33:52.000Z","publishedOn":"Tue Apr 19 2022 13:33:52 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","author":"mike-korostelev","category":"AWS","hidden":false,"featured":false,"public":"Thu Mar 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","image":"/content/623b4df73710503348866d01.png","thumbnail":"/content/623b4df73710503348866d01.png","toc":[{"id":"the-triage-process","depth":2,"text":"The triage process"},{"id":"some-people-on-twitter-are-saying-aws-is-having-an-outage-in-us-east-1","depth":3,"text":"\"Some people on twitter are saying AWS is having an outage in us-east-1\""}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"TLDR: The gang experiences an AWS outage; customers report SHOWSTOPPERs; the gang triages the issues and attempts to implement an elaborate disaster recovery plan"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It is 11:03 AM on a Thursday, US-EAST-1, Pennsylvania.

This is meant as a companion, to help better communicate, to our non-professional colleagues, what we mean when we say \"technical debt\".\n\n‍  \n\nAs a software professional for almost 20 years (do I get a watch or plaque soon?) I've had more passionate discussions about technical debt than any other topic. It is right up there with the iconic 3rd rail topics: Tabs-v-Spaces, Mac-v-Windows, Java-v-Python and type systems.\n\n  \n\nFrom all these passionate discussions and online comments I have distilled a taxonomy of the dimensions of debt. All these types of debt at their core describe a trade off in time. Meaning they have a now vs later quality. What makes a reasoned discussion difficult is that they trade different quantities (mostly unmeasured) of different units across time with different potential probabilities of happening.\n\n  \n\nThis is what a decision of technical debt could sound like applied to a non-software example. You take your car into the shop since the check engine light came on. The mechanic finds a slow leak in the radiator and offers you the following choices:\n\n* do nothing, risking totaling the car if the engine over heats\n* have it resolved in 15 mins for $25, by adding coolant, then $25 every month going forward, otherwise #badthingshappen\n* have it patched by end of day for $150 but then be back in the same position if/when the patch fails\n* have it replaced for $300 but your car will be in the shop for a week for parts to be ordered\n\n  \n\n#### So which is the best solution? Which do you pick?\n\n  \n\nWell, that is impossible to answer. There is no right answer.\n\n  \n\nIn this example it depends on:\n\n* your expected rate of some future events (how long will patch last? will leak get worse?)\n* your need for the car to be working now (are you leaving on road trip vacation tomorrow?)\n* your expected amount of future use of the car (are you planning to sell the car soon?)\n* your bank account balance? (do you have any money?)\n* your expected future cash flows (do you get paid next friday?)\n* cost to borrow money (how much does your credit card charge?)\n\n  \n\nIt is trivial to construct a scenario where the \"obvious\" choice would be any one of those options. The dimensions of the choice are:\n\n* amount of money now vs later\n* time till the car is working\n* expected usage of the car in the future\n\n  \n\nBelow is my attempt to at least describe and name the dimensions of technical debt akin to naming technical design patterns. If you think I missed a type or mischaracterized a type please tell me on twitter: [@seekayel](https://twitter.com/seekayel)\n\n  \n\nDimensions of Debt\n==================\n\nChange time cost\n----------------\n\nCost:\n\n* Any future changes take more time.\n\n  \n\nHow you will hear it described:\n\n* If we want to make changes later we will first have to undue this work\n* Next time we will first have to do x, y, z before we can make a change\n* This will make unscheduled Project ABC that we want harder\n* This is brittle and is more likely to break on the next change (increased error rate)\n* On boarding/teaching new people is harder\n* This is a tax on future changes\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n* Bad credit score - all future borrowing will be more expensive\n* Currency wide inflation/devaluation - all future consumption becomes more expensive (assuming you are on a fixed income)\n\n  \n\nRuntime cost\n------------\n\nCost:\n\n* Fixed cost in time per unit of time (eg 2hrs per week)\n* Fixed cost in time per unit of system usage (eg 1hr per 1,000 user signups)\n\n  \n\nHow you will hear it described:\n\n* We have to spend X hours of support per week\n*   20% of our staff hours works on escalations\n\n  \n\nFinancial Translations\n\n* Interest only loan - will need to continue to pay until you pay off principle\n* Selling/Buying insurance\n\n  \n\nOpportunity Cost\n----------------\n\nCost:\n\n* Whole sets of features aren't considered or built due to existing code/system/design\n\n  \n\nHow you will hear it described:\n\n* We don't build X or Y\n* We don't measure/report on X or Y\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n* Sunk cost fallacy\n* Do you transition the same factory from producing lower value product to higher value product\n* Career transition: forgo income, training/education expense, moving costs for future income\n\n  \n\nInterpretation:\n\nThis can be confused with the argument that actions aren't taken because the cost is too high. The focus here should be on the Opportunity that is missed. What could be but isn't, instead of the cost of what is.\n\n  \n  \n\nOrganizational Risk  \n-------------------\n\nCost:\n\n* The organization assumes: financial, reputational, operational or recruiting/retention risk.\n\n  \n\nHow it is described:\n\n* If X happens we will have to spend Y days scrambling to fix\n* If it breaks we will have an outage\n* If it breaks we will have a PR disaster/go out of business\n* If it breaks we will be open to legal liability\n* If it breaks we will have a security incident\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n* Selling uncovered puts\n* Selling uncovered calls\n* Uninsured against fire/flood/earthquake\n* Forgivable 0% interest only loan, but potential for demand payment\n\n  \n\nInterpretation:\n\nThis can be considered a compound dimension. It could include both the probability that the potential risk occurs along with the probable distribution of potential outcomes. For maximum clarity of communication I would suggest this dimension be discussed as the range of severity of the outcome, if the potential risk comes to pass.\n\n‍\n\n  \n\nMoney Cost  \n----------\n\nCost:\n\n* The organization pays more money aka US Dollars ($) than is strictly necessary.\n\n  \n\nHow it is described:\n\n* The servers are too \"big\"\n* The clusters aren't sized \"right\"\n* We need to optimize process X for less memory\n* We need to archive some/all of our data/logs\n* We need to turn off things are aren't using\n\n  \n\nFinancial Similarities:\n\n* That gym membership that still is charged to your card each month even though you don't go.\n\n  \n\nInterpretation:\n\nThis is pretty straight forward, everyone in the organization understands dollars as a unit of cost. Where this is becomes more complicated is in the tradeoffs for any change with: how long it will take, what risk the organization assumes implementing it and the project coordination time to ensure one team's waste isn't another teams KPI.\n\n‍\n\nPostscript  \n----------\n\nAs a business person you will probably be more concerned about Opportunity Cost and Organizational Risk than Runtime Cost or Change Time Cost.

This fact is even proven by StackOverFlow's recent survey polling hundreds of thousands of developers. \n\n![top-wanted-frameworks.png](/content/react-dev-2022/top-wanted-frameworks.png)\n\nHaving already covered [Vue development in our prior article in this series](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/i-made-the-same-app-3-times-in-3-different-frameworks-heres-what-i-learned) comparing web frameworks, it's only fair to give React an equal chance of showing-off its features and community-made treasures.\n\nAnd while React is backed by multi-trillion dollar company, Meta (or Facebook), it's [open-source community](https://github.com/facebook/react) is still one of the key factors of its large success. In this article, we'll go through the React development process for beginners and developers who just need a quick refresher.\n\nWe'll build a [website for publicly sharing short-messages, called](https://ithink-react.cyclic.app/) **[\"ithink\"](https://ithink.cyclic.app/)**. It's like Twitter, but with no accounts and you can't delete what you post.\n\n[https://github.com/ithink-corp/react](https://github.com/ithink-corp/react)\n\n## First, we need an API\n\nIf you play around with the CodePen above, you'll quickly realize that the database is not fake.\n\nWe actually have a [back-end side of our application](https://github.com/ithink-corp/api): it handles the storing and retrieving of simple text data. It's also built on [Amazon's S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) object storage service.\n\n[https://github.com/ithink-corp/api](https://github.com/ithink-corp/api)\n\nA developer would normally spend hours and hours setting-up a database like this, and it's not free either. Luckily for us, we get a free instance of the AWS S3 Storage when we [use Cyclic](https://app.cyclic.sh/#/). No credit card is required.\n\n[![Deploy to Cyclic Button](https://deploy.cyclic.app/button.svg)](https://deploy.cyclic.app/ithink-corp/api)\n\n## How do we create a new React project?\n\nA beginner shouldn't have to create *anything* from scratch. \n\nThat's a fact, and the React community recognizes it so much that they built a completely interactive program that helps newcomers setup their projects without much hassle.\n\n![create-react-app.svg](/content/react-dev-2022/create-react-app.svg)\n\nIt's called `create-react-app`, and it uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) under the hood, but you don't need to know anything about them. But I'd be irresponsible if I told you that you'll never encounter these two programs, so I recommend saving these articles [about webpack](https://dev.to/anitaparmar26/webpack-5-guide-for-beginners-314c) and [Babel](https://www.sitepoint.com/babel-beginners-guide/). Read them when you're ready.\n\nIt's finally time to use this magical software. Make sure that you [have NodeJS and NPM installed on your machine](https://nodejs.org/en/), then launch your terminal and run the following command in your preferred directory:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app my-app\ncd my-app\nnpm start\n```\n\nIf you're not using Linux or MacOS for programming, check out this [cheat-sheet covering our commands' counter-parts in Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/).\n\nDon't worry if it takes unusually long for these commands to execute. They may take longer to run if you have a slower internet connection. Please give it some time, as you only need to run it once per project.\n\n\n<br><br>\n<video src=\"/content/react-dev-2022/Scroll_Capture_2022-08-10_at_8.34.52_PM.webm\" playsinline autoplay muted loop style=\"max-width: 730px;\"></video>\n<br><br>\n\n\n\nWhen these commands finally cease to run, a new tab will automatically open in your current web browser. While not much, the source-code behind it is critical to the development that we're gonna do in this article.\n\nRegardless of what starter is given to us when we run `create-react-app`, the first step is to actually erase all of it. Yes, you heard me correctly; we're gonna erase *almost* all of what this magical program does.\n\nBut don't fret, the part that we're gonna delete is not the useful part of the React template, so go ahead and run this command:\n\n```bash\nrm src/* -r # erase all files in the src/ folder\ntouch src/index.js # create a new file called \"index.js\" in the src/ folder\n```\n\nWe already did too much change, but we can go a step further and craft our own folders. A good folder structure is key to a well-organized and future-proof project. There are many [not-so-well-agreed-on candidates](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) out there, but we're gonna go simple and create only two new directories:\n\n```bash\nmkdir src/components src/utils # create two directories in the src/ folder\n```\n\nAs their name suggests, [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (like the pop-up modal) will go into the `components/` folder, and useful functions (like a function to post data to the server) will go into the `utils/` sibling.\n\nAnother step that we would do in this stage is to set-up [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/) as they're used in this project. These packages both contain *detailed* guides that will help you set them up for yourself. This is just another consequence of the wide popularity of React.\n\nNo beginner tutorial covers this, but there's a little secret in programming that you should start practicing as soon as possible. It's the use of [linters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)), programs that enforce [style-guides in your code](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) and catch bugs before they happen. I recommend using [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/getting-started), the most popular linter in the JavaScript world. Setting-it up is easy, as covering in the linked guide.\n\n## How do we create a component in React?\n\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"zYWJENQ\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/zYWJENQ\">\n  React ithink 1</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nAs it currently stands, our app is not functional. This stems from the fact that the `index.js` script is still empty, and that's because we just created it.\n\nLet's learn a new fact about React: each application must have *one* **main component**. It's like the `<body>` element, where all the content is held. React places the insides of the main component inside a top-level `#root` element, as you can see in the following image:\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-10 22-42-22.png](/content/react-dev-2022/Screenshot_from_2022-08-10_22-42-22.png)\n\nAs you might have guessed, we create this main component inside the `index.js` file. It might sound scary to create something from scratch… But it's not, because it always resembles the following template:\n\n```jsx\n// The imports\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'\n\n// The component\nclass App extends React.Component {\n\t\t// The JavaScript Logic\n\t\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\t\tsuper(props)\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// The HTML Markup\n\t\t// Notice how we use className instead of class; this is important!\n\t\t// read this: https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html\n    render() {\n\t\t\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header className=\"...\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1>ithink</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t}\n}\n\n// Injecting the component inside the #root element\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))\nroot.render(<App />)\n```\n\nHold on! Those are a lot of new things that you may have never seen before. First of all, there's the presence of [imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). Please make sure that your understanding of these two concepts is rock-solid before continuing with this article.\n\nBut there's one other thing that still stands out, and it's surely new to all beginner React developers. It's the \"weird\" mix of JavaScript code and HTML markup. This odd format is called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), the **J**ava**S**cript E**x**tension. All you need to know about it for now is that it makes the inclusion of HTML markup inside JavaScript code okay.\n\n- **It doesn't always work!**\n    \n    With JSX, this is **not** okay:\n    \n    ```jsx\n    render() {\n    \t<article>...</article>\n    \t<article>...</article>\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    But *this* is:\n    \n    ```jsx\n    render() {\n    \t<div>\n    \t\t<article>...</article>\n    \t\t<article>...</article>\n    \t</div>\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    **Lesson learned:** always wrap your HTML markup around *one* and *only one* element.\n    \n\n## How do we listen to click events in React?\n\nWe all know how to attach buttons to logic using pure JavaScript code, but the same task is done quite differently (and quite more simply as you'll see) in React. We're gonna be using the `onClick` attribute, and while it's already available in pure JavaScript, its usage is quite more common in React.\n\n```jsx\nclass App extends React.Component {\n\t...\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t<button onClick=\"this.toggleModal\">New</button>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWith one simple attribute, we're able to call any method defined on the component. It's recommended to define component methods in the following manner:\n\n```jsx\nclass App extends React.Component {\n\t...\n\t// Bad! :(\n\ttoggleModal() {\n\t\t// do stuff...\n\t}\n\n\t// Okay :)\n\ttoggleModal = () => {\n\t\t// do stuff...\n\t}\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nLong story short, the first style would prohibit your method from accessing the [`this` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), which you would need to alter other parts of the component. On the other hand, the second method is fine and you should make it a habit to define class methods in that style.\n\n## How do we create a toggle in React?\n\nAlmost every user-interface component has one or more toggles in it, and our pop-up modal is no different. With a Boolean toggle, we can dictate if the modal is either open or closed. Thankfully, creating toggles is no hassle at all.\n\nVariables that control the UI are all collectively called the **state**, and our modal toggle is clearly one of them. The state is anything from data displayed in the application to user input to toggles that can do pretty much everything. When a state variable changes, the component is quickly and efficiently refreshed. Creating stateful variables is also the easiest thing in the world:\n\n```jsx\nclass App extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props)\n        this.state = {\n            isModalOpen: false,\n        }\n    }\n\t\t...\n}\n```\n\nToggles wouldn't be very interesting if we couldn't actually *toggle* them. This logic falls into the component method that we created earlier. Unfortunately, mutating stateful variables is quite counter-intuitive:\n\n```jsx\ntoggleModal = () => {\n\t// Wrong! :(\n\tthis.state.isModalOpen = true\n\n\t// Correct! :)\n\tthis.setState({\n\t\tisModalOpen: true\n\t})\n}\n```\n\n## How do we create multiple components in React?\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"XWEPeaw\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/XWEPeaw\">\n  React ithink 2</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nAside from the main component, applications are composed of a ton of UI parts that must all be organized in an effective fashion. We created the `components/` folder for *this* reason; it's time to finally put it to use!\n\nI'm also gonna introduce to you a new template for creating components in React, and it's the simplest one. Instead of classes, which we may not all be comfortable with, we're gonna use functions, which we definitely all have used enough times before that we could even write them with our eyes closed. Please make sure that you're fluent with [JavaScript exports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) before following with this article:\n\n```jsx\n// components/modal.js\n\nexport function NewModal(props) {\n  // notice the use of 'htmlFor' instead of 'for'\n  // read this to understand why: https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <dialog open>\n        <main>\n          <form method=\"dialog\">\n            <label htmlFor=\"content\">Content</label>\n            <textarea id=\"content\" autoFocus></textarea>\n\n            <div>\n              <button value=\"cancel\">Cancel</button>\n              <button value=\"default\">Post</button>\n            </div>\n          </form>\n        </main>\n        <footer>\n          <p>Whatever you write will become public.</p>\n        </footer>\n      </dialog>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAnd while our component is now *almost* done, it won't magically appear in our application. One more step that we must take is to import the modal into the main component. It's easy to do and very similar to native HTML elements:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Modal } from './components/modal'\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n\t...\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t<Modal />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWe also can't forget about the toggle logic that we just implemented in the last section of this article, so we must put it to use. It's easy to tell React to *conditionally* show an element based on a Boolean **state variable**. The syntax that I'm about to introduce is quite new, and it's special to **JSX**:\n\n```jsx\n{ this.state.isModalOpen && <Modal/> }\n```\n\nThe double brackets are key to combining JavaScript logic with HTML markup. They can contain *almost* anything from calculations to String manipulations and even lists of HTML elements as we'll soon see in this guide:\n\n```jsx\n{ 'Hello' }\n{ 5 + 5 }\n{ 'Hello' + ' World' }\n```\n\nThis neat feature of JSX is called **[interpolation](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-understand-and-use-interpolation-in-jsx),** and we can even combine it with JavaScript's [logical AND operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) (&&) to conditionally display HTML markup depending on a variety of possibilities:\n\n```jsx\n{ false && <div></div> /* will NEVER display */ }\n{ true && <div></div> /* will ALWAYS display */ }\n{ condition && <div></div> /* will ONLY display if condition is TRUE */ }\n```\n\n## How do we submit data to the server with a React component?\n\nAfter having already covered the process of listening to click events, it's no surprise that form submission won't be much of a hassle at all. I will therefore quickly cover it right now. And please notice how we don't have to use the `this` keyword anymore with function-based components.\n\n```jsx\nexport function NewModal(props) {\n  async function onSubmit(e) {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    // TODO: submit data to the server\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n        ...\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBut while this is all fun and games for us, it's still critical to pose the following question: *how do we get the input's value in React?* To answer this seemingly easy question, I have to introduce you to **[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)**, the *most* important concepts in modern development. And while they're a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial, we're gonna use a handy hook to create **state variables** for function-based components.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport function NewModal(props) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('')\n  ...\n\n  return (\n    ...\n    <textarea\n      value={message}\n      onChange={(event) => setMessage(event.target.value)}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThat's surprising simply! With the `useState` hook, we're able to both *access* the stateful variable `message` and *mutate* it using its `setMessage` sibling. With these two gems, we used JSX interpolation to set the value of the text-area and respond to change events by updating the state. Expect to see this pattern again-and-again in React applications.\n\n```jsx\nimport { postMessage } from '../utils/server'\n\n// it's now easy to post data to the server!\nasync function onSubmit(e) {\n\te.preventDefault()\n\tawait postMessage(message)\n}\n```\n\nWe still can't *actually* submit data to our server without writing a script to do that job. As a utility function, we're gonna put this logic inside a new file named `server.js` in the `utils/` directory. There's nothing new here, just an ordinary data [`fetch()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to communicate with our server.\n\n```jsx\n// utils/server.js\n\nexport async function postMessage(message) {\n    await fetch('https://ithink-api.cyclic.app/', {\n        method: 'post',\n        headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({\n            text: message,\n        }),\n    })\n}\n```\n\n## How do we close a modal when clicked outside in React?\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"RwMYLjp\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/RwMYLjp\">\n  React ithink 3</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nOne feature that we see again and again in websites is the ability to close pop-ups by tapping anywhere outside their area. This is clearly positive for the user-experience of our application, so it's not crazy that we're gonna be adding it, even in this high-level tutorial. \n\nThankfully, we don't have to do much code ourselves thanks to the great React community. Being such an important feature, experienced developers have already implemented it and shipped it along-with dozens of other small utilities as **hooks**. (yes, hooks are marking their presence once again; I told you that they're very important concepts!) It's all packaged in a nifty library called [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use).\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useClickAway } from 'react-use'\n\nexport function NewModal(props) {\n\t\t...\n\n    const containerRef = useRef(null)\n    useClickAway(containerRef, () => props.onClose())\n\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<dialog ref={ containerRef }>...</dialog>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n}\n```\n\nNotice how we're also making-use of yet another hook, `useRef`. It's one of the most popular hooks out there, because its function is one that's very important. The `useRef` hook gives us access to the DOM; using it is as simple as adding a `ref` attribute to the desired HTML element as you can see in the code snippet above.\n\n## How do we display a list of items in React?\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"KKoxXrJ\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"eludapens\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens/pen/KKoxXrJ\">\n  React ithink 4</a> by Eluda (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/eludapens\">@eludapens</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nGood news! We're done with the modal component! But we're still missing one major part of our application: the list of messages. Not much is new here, so let's just create a new component file named `message-list.js` in the `components/` directory as usual.\n\n```jsx\n// index.js\nimport { MessageList } from './components/message-list'\n\nrender() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t<main><MessageList /></main>\n\t\t</div>\n\t)\n}\n\n// components/message-list.js\n\nexport function MessageList(props) {\n\tif (props.messages) {\n\t\t// Display list of messages\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t)\n\t} else {\n\t\t// Display loading skeleton\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we're using an if-condition to decide which UI to display. If data is loaded, we're gonna return a list showing all of it. Otherwise, we're gonna show a [loading skeleton](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-skeleton-screens-using-css-for-better-user-experience/). Of course, none of these things is currently being shown. That's because I have to introduce you to a new concept in React.\n\nRemember JSX interpolation? There's something very interesting we can do with this magical feature. It's possible to use the [Array map() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to return a *dynamic* list of HTML elements!\n\n```jsx\n<div>\n\t{ props.messages.map(({ message }) => <p key={message}>{ message }</p>) }\n</div>\n```\n\nIsn't that so amazing? We can do the same thing to display the loading skeleton.\n\n```jsx\n<div>\n\t{ Array.from(Array(20).keys()).map((number) => <div key={number}></div>) }\n</div>\n```\n\nNotice the use of the `key` property in both examples. It's important to include it when using this interpolation feature, as it helps React keep track of the list of elements. It's critical that these keys are all *unique*!\n\n## How do we load a list of data from the server with a React component?\n\nWhile we already built the messages listing component, it still doesn't display any data and it's stuck in the loading state. Obviously, we haven't made any effort to actually load messages from the server yet. Thankfully, this is not very different from former server function that we just implemented.\n\n```jsx\nclass App extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n\t\t\tsuper(props)\n\t\t\tthis.state = {\n\t\t\t\t...,\n\t\t\t\tmessages: null\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n}\n```\n\nAs soon as the main component is created, we wish to load data from the server. There's no immediately obvious way of implementing this logic, because you still don't know about **[lifecycle hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)**. With these magical devices, we're able to run whatever logic we want at important times in a component's \"lifecycle\".\n\n```jsx\nclass App extends React.Component {\n    ...\n    componentDidMount() {\n        // load items\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith the `compnentDidMount` lifecycle hook, we're able to run whatever we want when the component is finally rendered, which is exactly what we were looking for. With that done, we're left with the task of filling the `messages` **stateful variable** with data from the server.\n\n```jsx\nimport { getMessages } from './utils/server'\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n    ...\n    componentDidMount() {\n        const messages = await getMessages()\n\n\t\t\t\tthis.setState({\n\t\t\t\t\tmessages: messages,\n\t\t\t\t})\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOf course, we cannot dismiss the logic that actually retrieves data from the server.\n\n```jsx\n// utils/server.js\n\nexport async function getMessages() {\n    const res = await fetch('https://ithink-api.cyclic.app/', {\n        headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        },\n    })\n    const items = await res.json()\n    return items.map((item) => ({\n        message: item,\n    }))\n}\n```\n\n## How do we deploy a React project to the Internet?\n\nIt's hard-enough to create an entire application in one's local computer, it's its own industry with the name: \"**Frontend Development**\". A frontend developer should not have to worry about the intricacies behind servers and deployment.\n\nLucky for us, Cyclic gives us the ability to deploy React applications to the cloud for free, by just clicking one button and adding one script to our application. With [Cyclic's React starter](https://github.com/cyclic-software/starter-react-app), we know to add the following script to the root of our project:\n\n```jsx\n// /server.js\n\nconst express = require('express')\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nconst app = express()\n\n// This configures static hosting for files in /public that have the extensions\n// listed in the array.\nvar options = {\n  dotfiles: 'ignore',\n  etag: false,\n  extensions: ['htm', 'html','css','js','ico','jpg','jpeg','png','svg'],\n  index: ['index.html'],\n  maxAge: '1m',\n  redirect: false\n}\napp.use(express.static('build', options))\n\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`React app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)\n})\n```\n\nIt's also important to add the following changes to the `package.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"scripts\": {\n\t\t- \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\n\t\t+ \"start\": \"node server.js\",\n    + \"dev\": \"react-scripts start\",\n\t}\n}\n```\n<br><br>\n<video src=\"/content/react-dev-2022/output.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" style=\"max-width: 730px;\"></video>\n<br><br>\n\nWith that done, all it takes to launch our app to the world-wide-web is creating a Cyclic account and clicking the **DEPLOY** button. Trust me, it's so satisfying seeing it do all the work *for you!* And you can even choose your own free subdomain afterwards! 😃\n\n[![Deploy to Cyclic Button](https://deploy.cyclic.app/button.svg)](https://deploy.cyclic.app/ithink-corp/api)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd voila, our application is done, just like that! The React development process is definitely a unique one, and you can immediately tell many differences from the [VueJS process that we covered in our last article](https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/i-made-the-same-app-3-times-in-3-different-frameworks-heres-what-i-learned).\n\nWe covered many features of React:\n\n- Creating new projects with `create-react-app`,\n- listening to and handling events,\n- hooks and the react-use library,\n- custom components,\n- JSX interpolation,\n- stateful variables,\n- dynamic lists.\n- DOM refs.\n\nAnd while we just scraped the surface of what React is capable of, we still got a good idea of what the React development process is like and that's enough to help us choose the best framework for our purposes.\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/the-modern-refresher-to-react-development-in-2022","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283666515},"$loki":23},{"slug":"the-vc-business-model-and-why-vcs-invest","title":"The VC Business Model and Why VCs Invest","summary":"The majority of the confusion or difficulty I had raising Venture Capital was that I didn’t fully understand the VC business model.

There is nothing extraordinary about my VC experiences. I have done the following: raised an angel round and two institutional rounds (and failed at two rounds?) at a company I co-founded in the GovTech/Community space (SeeClickFix). I have participated in pitches as CTO of a pre-PMF (product market fit) mortgage tech company (HeavyWater). I have raised a friends-and-family round at my current Cloud Infrastructure company ([https://www.cyclic.sh](https://www.cyclic.sh))\n\n‍\n\nThe venture funding landscape is evolving. It seems there is more innovation now than at any other time. My goal here is to explain the general case so that you have a reference point for understanding the more novel or innovative approaches. Aka there are exceptions to everything here, but first let us learn the base case.\n\n‍\n\nThe majority of the confusion or difficulty I had raising Venture Capital was that I didn’t fully understand the VC business model. I didn’t understand the individual investors and their incentives. I didn’t appreciate the incentives for the fund itself. Nor did I understand what the fund’s investors (Limited Partners aka LPs) were expecting. Hopefully this will help you understand what I didn’t.\n\n‍\n\nThe VC business model\n=====================\n\n‍\n\nVenture funds are companies. Their purpose for existence is to make money from making investments in other companies.\n\n‍\n\nThey are composed of Limited Partners (LPs) and a General Partner (GP). The GP is the company owned and run by the \"VC\" you meet at some networking event. The VC has formed these companies and raised money from LPs. Part of the structure of the fund is that it will exist for no more than 10 years. At the end of that time all proceeds or investment holdings will be sent back to the LPs (minus any fees for the GP).\n\n‍\n\n![](/content/625dce5fe5890977b45753cb_vc-structure-angellist.png)\n\nVC Fund Structure (photo credit [Angel List](https://learn.angellist.com/articles/venture-capital-fund#toc_8_H2))\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nThe LPs invest in the fund because they want to make money. The \"Limited\" in LP refers to the time the investor doesn’t spend working in the business. They send a check and that is their involvement.\n\n‍\n\nThe VC formed the GP and raised money from the LPs because they want to make money. The GP charges a management fee of 2% per year on assets the LP invests with the fund.\n\n‍\n\nThe GP will charge carry, aka 20% of any profits from the investments they make. The LPs get to first recover their initial investment, including those 2% fees, then any additional profits are shared with the GP.\n\n‍\n\nThe Lifecycle of a single VC fund\n=================================\n\n‍\n\nJust as VC funds have standard structures and standard fees, they have a standard development and lifecycle. Understanding where a particular fund is in this progression will help you understand their expected behavior. Also, a single VC might have multiple funds that are in different stages of this trajectory. I have found that VCs are very open and willing to talk about which fund they are actively investing out of, how big it is, when they raised it and their average check size. I have always been able to find this information by asking.\n\n‍\n\nFirst Years: Load up the Plate\n------------------------------\n\n‍\n\nAs a new entrepreneur I didn't realize how critical time fit with a VC was. After they raise from their investors (LPs) they are on a time crunch to get the money invested. They want to invest in good companies but they only have about 1-3 years to invest. This means it is much easier to raise from a VC who has just raised. They are rapidly putting money to work. They just arrived at the buffet with an empty plate. Everything looks good and they don't have anything that is a better alternative already on their plate.\n\n‍\n\nMiddle Years: Getting Picky\n---------------------------\n\n‍\n\nAfter that first phase they transition into a slower but still active investment role. In this 4-6 year middle window a VC will still take meetings but are much less likely to make new investments. At this phase they have a full plate but are still wandering around the buffet looking for great options. The threshold is now higher for inclusion. They may prefer the truffle parm fries they just found (your company), but they already have cajun curly fries which are almost as good (a company they already invested in). However they may have raised a new fund so they could be in two phases at once - make sure to ask!\n\n‍\n\nThese VCs won't tell you that they probably won't invest. They are happy to ask questions and probe into your business. They get tremendous market intelligence from taking these meetings. They get to see:\n\n* What people are pitching (deal flow)\n\n* How is the market is responding to these pitches?\n\n* Do you raise quickly? Do you struggle to raise? At what price? On what terms?\n\n* Benchmark strategy data for their current portfolio companies eg Are social ads working? What is your customer acquisition cost? What are your churn rates?\n\n* Potential insights for their current portfolio companies\n\n* Optionality of investing in an amazing company/founder eg maybe your company is the best investment they have seen in their professional life\n\n‍\n\nFinal Years the Tail End: Finishing up\n--------------------------------------\n\n‍\n\nAt this point they have transitioned to harvesting or running off the portfolio. They are returning funds to investors. They know that their investment fund will close after 7-10 years so this is a period of actively winding down.\n\n‍\n\nAt the buffet they have switched to dessert and coffee. It would be an extraordinary turn of events such that you could convince them to take a scoop of some new main course. More likely they have raised another fund, probably at the end of the first year or two and any pitch would get investment from that fund. So effectively that VC is \"loading their plate\" even if one of their funds is in this phase of winding down.\n\n‍\n\nOutcome Fit\n===========\n\n‍\n\nA natural tendency when considering an endeavor (business or other) is to start with the likelihood of success. This line of thinking asks how probable each outcome is. It is a frame of thinking that trades size of outcome for certainty in outcome. Increasing certainty can raise the floor on returns, but also lower the ceiling.\n\n‍\n\nWhen the VC was raising money from LPs they put together a spreadsheet that described the basic economics of the venture fund. Roughly it modeled the following for 10 investments:\n\n* 5 will fail completely, the investments will be a complete loss\n\n* 3 will do ok, they will each return somewhere between 3x\n\n* 1 will do great, it will return 10x\n\n* 1 will do amazing, it will return 25x+\n\n‍\n\nThis would put the fund in the top-1% of VCs. A more likely outcome of those 10 investments is:\n\n* 6 will fail\n* 3 will do ok they will each return on average ~3x\n* 1 will do great, it will return ~5x\n\n‍\n\nThis would put the VC roughly at the median returns for all VC firms.

If we want to have our non-technical colleagues listen and act, we need to either improve our use of the financial terms they understand or we need to translate our message into business outcomes that they do care about.\n\n‍  \n\n> business leaders don’t care if jobs are hard or annoying or take longer than they \"should\" ... we need to translate our message into business outcomes that they do care about\n\n‍  \n\nTo capture these opportunities we need to go back to the beginning. The only way to remedy these failures in communication is to refactor our language and use of terms. We need to better define technical debt and the terms we use to describe it. The use of units of dollars is a powerful tool to communicate to those not part of the software design, build, and run value stream. Let's start with how the non-technical listener will understand the terms of debt.\n\n‍  \n\n> using a unit of dollars is a powerful tool to communicate to those not part of building software\n\n‍\n\n### What is Financial Debt?\n\n  \n\n**Debt** is a contractual agreement that allows the **borrower** to to shift future **consumption** into the present. This also allows the **lender** to do the reverse, shift present consumption into the future. The amount of consumption that is shifted is the **principal**. The amount that is still due at any point of time is the **balance**. The cost per unit of shifted consumption is the **interest rate**. The distance through time that the consumption is shifted is the **term** of the debt. The frequency and amount that is paid to service the debt is the **payment schedule**. All of these terms should be familiar to most consumers who have a mortgage, credit cards or a car loan.\n\n  \n\nNotice that there is no judgment or statement if debt is good (**productive**) or bad (**unproductive**). If you use debt to purchase a house, is that good or bad? That question can only be answered in the context of the cost of that debt (**interest rate**) and if you are changing your monthly consumption on housing. If your mortgage payment is less than your current rent then it is probably good debt. By borrowing money you have lowered your monthly expenses. This is a productive use of debt.\n\n  \n\nThis view of debt is much more inline with how companies reason about their debt. The primary questions are:\n\n1. What is the cost of the debt?\n2. What additional value will the debt buy?\n3. What is the expected change to cash flow from this investment?\n\n  \n\nBorrowing money to build a bigger factory that will enable more efficient production of your products is probably a productive use of debt. Borrowing to fund bonuses for executives is probably unproductive.\n\n  \n  \n\n### A Different Conversation\n\n  \n\nIf we use these terms to communicate the technical debt we are holding as a team the communication could look like this.\n\n  \n\n**Techie**: Oof, we had to give discounts that amounted to 1% of our sales again last month.  \n\n**Business person**: Yeah but what can we do about it?  \n\n**Techie**: Well, our order system is filled with technical debt. We can either keep paying with the discounts for the failed orders, or we can invest in 3-6 weeks of engineering time to half the error rate. This could delay other features.  \n\n**Business person**: If you can half the error rate we can afford to hire more engineers.\n","dir":"/posts","path":"/posts/we-sound-like-idiots-when-we-talk-about-technical-debt","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1673283666590},"$loki":26},{"slug":"why-i-started-cyclic","title":"Why I Started Cyclic","summary":"Choosing to start a company is a combination of an analytical and subjective decision.
