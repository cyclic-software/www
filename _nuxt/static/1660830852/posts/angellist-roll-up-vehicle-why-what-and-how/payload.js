We needed to bring them up to speed on why we were raising, and explain we needed their signatures on documents for the round even though the company had drag along rights.

For example: to get to the RUV page you navigate via the \"Deals\" menu item and the deal is listed under my \"Syndicate\". This all sorta makes sense given the product is essentially a Syndicate where the fee and carry are 0%. However it doesn’t really make sense when I am the company founder doing a RUV.
