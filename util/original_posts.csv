More on the round later. Multiple founder friends have asked about my experience and why I used an RUV. Here is the Why, What and How:</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>TL;DR</strong></h1><p><br></p><blockquote>A Roll Up Vehicle is a legal entity that can take investments from multiple investors or entities and then invest that money as a single entity on your company’s cap table. Here are the pros and cons for using an AngelList RUV as part of a venture capital fundraising round:</blockquote><p>‍<br></p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/61034dd64ba727b1f9120503_angellist_ruv.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>Visual depiction of how investments are rolled up onto your captable</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Pros</strong>:</h2><ul><li>Future rounds are simplified, exactly when most stressful</li><li>Future rounds are cheaper ($)</li><li>Investor's address and info is kept private</li><li>Simplified e-signature and funding for investors and company at time of investment</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h2><strong>Cons</strong>:</h2><ul><li>Some additional setup for the company (~1hr)</li><li>Small additional cost (now only filing fees https://www.angellist.com/blog/eliminating-fees-for-roll-up-vehicles)</li><li>Additional complexity describing to your investor who AngelList is and how they are involved</li></ul><p><br><br></p><h3><strong>Should I use a RUV?</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>I would definitely recommend an AngelList RUV to anyone raising an early venture capital round where:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>You expect to raise another round in the future&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>And one or more of these to apply:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>You have 10 or more angels</li><li>You have angels that do less than 4 deals a year</li><li>You have angels writing checks for less than $25k</li></ul><p><br><br></p><h3><strong>Cyclic - What we do</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>As a developer the complexity to go from your local to the cloud is increasing. This is driving cloud platform selection into a pre-design time decision. We are dedicated to solving both of these problems for developers. Our goal is to let you push to deploy while making cloud environment selection a runtime decision.

The deal terms were reasonably standard for VC deals. They included drag along provisions. We were first time founders and I think we did an “ok” job of keeping all of our investors updated on how the company was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite drag along rights (i.e. company able to “drag” small investors into a transaction if some percentage of shares in the company agree to the transaction), the lawyers involved with our second priced round wanted signed docs from all investors along with consent of spouse docs for any investment held by a person instead of trust or other entity. This meant that we needed to coordinate outreach to roughly ten angel investors, most of whom were non-professional angels. We needed to bring them up to speed on why we were raising, and explain we needed their signatures on documents for the round even though the company had drag along rights. Oh and by the way, we needed signatures from their spouses as well, leading them to have the same conversation with less fidelity with their spouse.</p><p><br></p><p>The more experienced angels who had larger checks generally understood the process and were more likely to have entities which they used to make the original investment. So they were either less likely to have questions and most were able to be a sole signer on behalf of the entity that held the investment. The converse of this was also true. The smaller check angels were more likely to have questions, they were less familiar with what was standard and they were more likely to need signatures from a spouse. Additionally, it seemed that the less experienced angels were less engaged with email and had longer turn around times.</p><p><br></p><p>In a vacuum, handling&nbsp; each of these conversations is manageable. However, once a closing date was set,&nbsp; all of these small “punch list” items seemed to bubble to the surface. It seemed that there was a spike in the length of items remaining once the date was set. The 7 to 14 days before closing are among the most stressful for a co-founder. In my experience, having extra tasks and communication on my plate was extra stress at exactly the wrong time.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>The 7 to 14 days before closing are among the most stressful for a co-founder... having extra tasks and communication on my plate was extra stress at exactly the wrong time.</blockquote><p><br></p><h3><strong>Why an RUV</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>The RUV prevents the need to keep going back to the early angels. It is a legal structure where the angels have already agreed that someone designed by the RUV organizer will be able to sign future docs related to their investment. The designated person can sign any future fundraising documents. In my case, I am that designated signer.</p><p><br></p><p>This means at the next funding round I will be able to sign on behalf of the RUV. So for a bit more time and cost upfront (and maybe a bit more complex conversation with the angels) I am able to decrease my complexity (and stress) at the time of each future funding round.</p><p><br><br></p><h3><strong>How it works for Founders</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Sign up and on-boarding were easy. I wrote a blurb on the company, uploaded a deck or memo, filled in some deal terms, identified notable co/lead-investors, targeted raise amount, and selected how I would pay the RUV fee (either company pays or investors pay). I didn’t have the exact form of the SAFE complete when I set up the RUV, it is only required at close, provided it is substantially the same terms as any of the listed co/lead investors.</p><p><br></p><p>For me there was some email back and forth with the AngelList team since they were still doing a staged rollout when I signed up. I had some questions during setup and emailed with two people who work at AngelList. Both were responsive and helpful. The email support felt personal and attentive.</p><p><br></p><p>My only complaints on the company product side are that the UI/UX was a bit complicated for just doing the RUV. It seemed it was more focused on syndicates and funds. If there is any “product” work for the AngelList team this is probably where it is. For example: to get to the RUV page you navigate via the “Deals” menu item and the deal is listed under my “Syndicate”. This all sorta makes sense given the product is essentially a Syndicate where the fee and carry are 0%. However it doesn’t really make sense when I am the company founder doing a RUV. Additionally I didn’t find a way to set a per investor minimum, perhaps I just missed it in interface. These are minor points of friction but they left me with a feeling that it was still an early product that wasn’t fully polished yet.</p><p><br><br></p><h3><strong>How it works for Investors</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>The investor side was smooth even for first time angels investing either personally or through an entity. The flow has e-signature to the RUV docs and the ability to enter bank account details so AngelList can initiate an ACH (electronic transfer). There is also the ability for the investors to wire if that is their preference.</p><p><br></p><p>That is literally it. Smooth and easy.<br><br><br></p><h3>Thoughts?

The <a href=""http://code-inline"">/</a> character is really just a rendered delimiter. You can actually specify <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html"">whatever you want </a>to be the delimiter for list/scan apis.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Anyway, under the hood, these prefixes are used to shard and partition data in S3 buckets across whatever wires and metal boxes in physical data centers. Since any character can be a delimiter, this actually happens over time as AWS&nbsp;discovers the access patterns for the data. This is important because while&nbsp;AWS&nbsp;will adapt to any pattern - the prefix design drives access patterns for human developers and impacts performance in large scale high volume read and write applications.</p><p>The limits on reads and writes are:</p><ul><li>3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests per second per prefix</li><li>5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix<br></li></ul><p>This means you can make up to 3500 write / 5500 read requests per second to add or look at <a href=""http://code-inline"">app/events/</a> files. Higher than that, and you may experience <a href=""http://code-inline"">503</a> or <a href=""http://code-inline"">429</a> errors, especially with burst traffic. <br></p><p>When faced with the challenge of producing or accessing big data with practical performance - <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html"">Best practices</a>, enterprise support, and your technical account manager (TAM) will recommend that you:</p><blockquote>... use an object key naming pattern that distributes your objects across multiple prefixes.<br></blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>Tech debt</h3><p>These best practices are usually overlooked in early MVPs and objects are likely stored with the familiar <a href=""http://code-inline"">folder/file</a> pattern. It doesn't take long for the issue to expose itself. The first performance issues are usually experienced on read when someone first tries large scale queries with tools like AWS Athena and competes with the customer-facing processes for S3 reads.<br></p><p>This is chalked up as a <a href=""https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/we-sound-like-idiots-when-we-talk-about-technical-debt"">repaying tech-debt</a> and work is done to adapt the existing patterns to best practices. Processes that used to produce <a href=""http://code-inline"">app/events/login-123123.json</a> are refactored to write <a href=""http://code-inline"">app/events/dt=yyyy-mm-dd/login-123123.json</a> instead. <br>‍<em>(Actually something like app/events/dt=yyyy-mm-dd/asdfasdfasdf.gz , building crawler schema to make parquet out of messy, dynamic json files is hard and you think you're smart and just enable gzip compression in firehose.)</em><br></p><p><strong>Cool.</strong> You configure the partition key <a href=""http://code-inline"">dt=yyyy-mm-dd</a> in the data catalog, write some documentation about how everyone should use date ranges to make queries efficient. All is well and the data science team can again do linear regressions aka “Machine Learning”<strong> </strong>to find out which events make the most money or, you know “drive business kpis”.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Back to our original problem</h3><p>Some time has passed and <strong>you now have a shitload of data in S3</strong>. Someone has noticed how much it costs and <strong>now you have to clean it up</strong>.<br></p><p>Hopefully, AWS is holding your hand on this one - you're a really great customer obviously.&nbsp;They will tell you, the two options you have to clean stuff up are:</p><ul><li><strong>Delete objects one by one</strong> manually by using the list and delete API’s <em>(yeah, sounds dumb)</em></li><li><strong>Set up lifecycle policies</strong> at the bucket level to expire objects based on prefix rules <em>(this sounds promising!!)</em></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Lifecycle policies are pretty great.</p><p>They work by first specifying a filter like:</p><ul><li>Apply by tag <em>(That would be sweet.. but no one tagged any of the objects that are already in there)</em></li><li>Apply by a size threshold <em>(There is no meaningful size difference between stuff you might want or not want)</em></li><li>Apply by prefix <em>(Yeeeah, that's the one)</em></li></ul><p>Then specifying a rule like:</p><ul><li>Expire after some time has passed</li><li>Move to a different storage class</li><li>Delete older versions of objects</li></ul><h3><br>Stop the bleeding<br></h3><p>Without much research, the prefix filter thing looks really good. Naturally, as it is with filters, everyone would need to decide what they want to keep and not keep. &nbsp;That sounds like a mess of calls and meetings. On that dilemma, the (actually good) advice from your partners at AWS - </p><blockquote>“Your costs are accumulating, we can help you move the really old stuff to Glacier to stop the bleeding.” <br>‍<em>- AWS&nbsp;bros</em></blockquote><p>There are obvious tradeoffs with Glacier. But since large scale reads, especially ones on old data are not often done, after some short all-hands discussions everyone agrees.</p><h3><br>The 100 thousand dollar button<br></h3><p>You go back and press the button in the console.

They suck so bad there is an entire industry focused on solving for this pile of suck.","<p>If you have ever worked with AWS as a developer then you will know what I mean, AWS tools suck. They suck so bad there is an entire industry focused on solving for this pile of suck. For just Infrastructure as Code, for example, there are Terraform, Pulumi and Serverless. AWS is famous for ""listening to customers"". So what gives? Why do their tools still feel clunky, complex and riddled with infuriating edge cases?<br></p><p><br></p><h3>tldr</h3><p>You, the developer, are not the customer.</p><p><br></p><p>The longer answer is a combination of several factors. Here are my three reasons for why things are the way they are.</p><p><br></p><h3>Reason 1: AWS never was a developer tools company</h3><p><br></p><p>AWS never won based on having the best experience or tooling. They offered one powerful value proposition, you could shorten your project lead time by using their services. You no longer need to do capacity planning for the number of disks (s3), servers (ec2) or network capacity (egregious egress). Oh, and they were fanatical about availability.</p><p><br></p><h3>Reason 2: AWS doesn't sell based on Dev Ex</h3><p><br></p><p>AWS is growing at least as faster than the cloud market as a whole [1], yet they have below average developer experience. The only way that this can happen is if their customers are purchasing for reasons other than quality of developer tools. If the decision maker cared about developer experience why do they keep choosing AWS? The only reasonable answer is the person picking doesn't prioritize Dev Experience over some other attributes of the vendor (that is for another post).</p><p><br></p><h3>Reason 3: If AWS wanted it they would have it</h3><p><br></p><p>Given the near 1 billion dollar a week capital expense annual run rate AWS was at in Q4 of 2020 [2], if it was of strategic importance for them to solve for better tooling they would. This is not a case of “not enough resources'', this is a case of the project not getting the internal priority to invest in improvement.</p><p><br></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><br></p><p>AWS continues to grow despite having bad tooling and developer experience. If it impacted their sales they would make it a priority. If they made it a priority to have great tooling, they would have it. The only conclusion is: bad tooling isn't affecting their sales. Therefore, sales decisions aren't being made at the level or for the reasons that developer tooling changes the outcome.</p><p><br></p><p>Which means AWS tools will continue to suck for the foreseeable future.</p><p><br><br><br></p><p>[1] <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/"">https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/</a></p><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.platformonomics.com/2021/03/follow-the-capex-oracle-fy21-q3-update/"">https://www.platformonomics.com/2021/03/follow-the-capex-oracle-fy21-q3-update/</a></p><p><br></p>"

Serverless-native applications can make it simpler to serve users globally and enable more effective recoveries with less effort.,"<p><em>(Part 1 of a series)</em></p><p>Building active-active in multiple regions can be expensive and complex. Serverless-native applications can make it simpler to serve users globally and enable more effective recoveries with less effort. </p><p>Starting from the end user making an http request and assuming there are two identical instances of an application running in two AWS regions - this and next several posts will discuss considerations, tools and solutions for building serverless active-active architectures.</p><h2><strong>Routing</strong></h2><p>The first touchpoint for a request is DNS routing. This where the cloud DNS&nbsp;(<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/route53/"">AWS&nbsp;Route53</a>) connects the request to your application's endpoints - in whatever region they are in the world. </p><h4>Which regional instance of the application to send the request to?</h4><p>AWS Route53 lets you select a routing policy for DNS records. A regional policy will route users the closest geographic region ($0.70 per million queries). A latency policy will route to the the lowest query latency record ($0.60 per million queries). For high traffic web services, the TTL value should be considered as most web clients cache dns for the specified TTL.</p><p>If the record is configured as an alias to an AWS service (like cloudfront and api gateway) - the dns queries are free.</p><h4>How to know that the instance in the region is actually healthy ✅ before routing the request?</h4><p>If a region is down (and it's not even your fault), Route53 does not know not to send requests there. To make Route53 know the state of an endpoint, health checks can be configured. Depending on the config, a health check is somewhere between $0.50 - $2.00 per month. Two ways to configure a health check are:</p><ul><li>Monitor an endpoint by continuously polling it from multiple regions - this will result in multiple requests per second to some endpoint where your application responds with some kind of 200. Since all these requests must be handled by something and can get expensive downstream from the traffic generated by the health check itself.</li><li>Monitor cloudwatch alarms - this lets you be more creative about what ‘healthy’ means and can go both ways on cost/complexity. This option is likely going to have more lag than monitoring an endpoint directly.</li></ul><p>Here the TTL is a more important consideration - since clients will cache dns - faster health-check polling intervals will not give you instantaneous routing switchover. So if users are actively using a service at the moment the switch over happens, you should have the expectation that they may still be hitting the failing endpoint until their dns cache expires.</p><p><strong><em>The next few posts will discuss these and other considerations, approaches and dirty hacks for building a low overhead active-active strategy with serverless on AWS:</em></strong></p><h4><strong>Compute</strong></h4><h5>How to process the requests in both regions without having to pay for two computes? </h5><h5>How to scale capacity if suddenly a single regional application instance must pick up the slack for a whole other region’s worth of traffic?</h5><h4><strong>Data</strong></h4><h5>How to make sure the data created by either regional application instance is available to the other?</h5><h4><strong>Ops</strong></h4><h5>Human decisions are political decisions, politics takes time, in a disaster time is scarce - how to remove humans from the process? </h5><h5>How to manage infrastructure across multiple regions without multiplying operational overhead?</h5><h4><strong>Latency</strong></h4><h5>How to deal with eventual consistency and the fact that data replication is not instantaneous?</h5><p>‍</p>"

The night before my departure my dad came into my room to check on my packing and inspect my gear. He got serious and gave me the following advice for how to stay alive, keep safe and make the most of my time.</p><p><br></p><p>It has stuck with me. It is the best, most concise advice I know for how to build a startup, be a parent or venture into the unknown.</p><p><br><br></p><h3>1. Show up</h3><p><br></p><p>This is meant in all its forms and in its most expansive definition. Showing up is being physically present, mentally present and emotionally present. It means showing up with an attitude of engagement.</p><p><br></p><h3>2. Pay attention</h3><p><br></p><p>So often our minds and our bodies live in two different places. Being present and paying attention to both the internal and external is shockingly hard. The people around us can tell when we are checked in or checked out mentally or emotionally. As a parent I've learned that kids are shockingly good at detecting emotional attention (or distraction ;).</p><p><br></p><h3>3. Do what needs to be done</h3><p><br></p><p>This could mean carrying bags, cooking dinner, starting to sing to keep spirits up, offering help or asking for help. It is about identifying the need and doing it (or helping) regardless of “shoulds” or “jobs”. Sometimes what needs to be done is letting someone struggle through a task they are learning. Being with them sometimes is what needs to be done.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p><h3>4. Don’t agree if you don’t agree</h3><p><br></p><p>In the context of the wilderness this meant if I wasn’t comfortable with the risks I needed to speak up. Sometimes keeping the group together is more important than the route that is taken. In those cases agree to keep the group together and disagree on the route. I've heard others describe this as ""disagree then commit."" This means taking a duty to fully express my opinion when we are discussing our plans. Then fully committing to making whichever plan we pick a success.</p><p><br><br></p><h3>5. Be open to outcome</h3><p><br></p><p>This is the most philosophical. This is also the hardest for me. It is about not wasting energy on: worrying, fretting, anguish or anger. Still care passionately about what I am doing, that I should have strong preferences. Work hard to create those outcomes I desire. But let go of the belief that I am the only force in the world. This is about focusing on the process used to make a decision, and not the result.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Thanks dad ❤️<br></p>"

Hence, quite simply, index.html is the entry-point to our application. It’s where you modify the <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;head&gt;</a> meta-tags, add class-names to the top-most elements such as <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;body&gt;</a> and <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;html&gt;</a>, and change the language of your website from English (""en"") to say, French (""fr"").</p><p id="""">It’s also impossible to avoid speaking about <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;div id=""app""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</a>. As we’ll see in an upcoming section, this is where all-things-Vue are injected. So let’s keep on exploring!</p><h3 id="""">Changing the body color</h3><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">The website we’re building has an overall dark theme, meaning that the <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;body&gt;</a> color should be changed from white to dark.</p><p id="""">After <a href=""https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite"" id="""">configuring TailwindCSS</a>, we’ll start adding these changes to our document.</p><p id="""">You must’ve already created a <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">src/index.css</a> file during your Tailwind configuration, and imported it from <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">src/main.js</a>.

What the heck is <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;template&gt;</a>?</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Before we get into that, let me explain a fundamental concept to you.. <strong id="""">Web components!</strong></li><li id="""">Web components give developers the ability to create their own tags:</li><li id=""""><a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;profile-card&gt;</a>, <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;emoji&gt;</a>, <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;close-button&gt;</a>, <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;code-editor&gt;</a></li><li id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">It’s like magic!</em></strong> You get to encapsulate your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web components are an elegant way to create user-interfaces that resemble native apps. They’re the future of the web.</li><li id="""">If this sounds cool to you, you’re probably wondering how to create these things.</li></ul><p id="""">So let me introduce… <strong id="""">Single File Components!</strong> (SFCs)</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">As you can see, SFCs split a component’s design into three logical parts, and they can come in any order:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">JavaScript logic:</strong> (<a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;script setup&gt;</a>) The brains of your component. Handles state, events, networking, etc…</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">HTML document:</strong> (<a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;template&gt;</a>) The semantics of your component.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">CSS declarations:</strong> (<a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;style scoped&gt;</a>) The style of your component.</li></ul><p id="""">Pretty neat, huh?</p><h3 id="""">Listening to click events</h3><p id="""">As it currently stands, the “new” button doesn’t do anything, and no one wants a useless button.</p><p id="""">So let’s change that! We must listen to a click event, and <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html"" id="""">in Vue, events</a> work like this:</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">We’ll come back to the openModal function later, when we actually create the modal!</p><h3 id="""">Creating a modal component</h3><p id="""">It’s time to put the src/components folder to good use. This is where we’ll be housing all our custom components.<a href=""https://codepen.io/eludadev/pen/VwXaRbb"" id="""">‍</a></p><div></div><p id="""">What you can see in the image above is the “New Modal” component, written into the NewModal.vue file.</p><p id="""">Create a new file at <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">src/components/NewModal.vue</a>. Fill it up with the usual SFC boilerplate:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">Let’s get the markup out of the way: (remember to use <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics"" id="""">the right semantics</a>)</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">Markup alone is not very useful without the JavaScript logic. Let’s attach event handlers to our button elements:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Okay, this is great! But notice that when you click on “post”, the page reloads. This is the default <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form"" id="""">behavior of HTML forms</a>.</p><p id="""">Normally, we’d change that by calling <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">e.preventDefault</a>. But Vue focuses so much on simplicity that there’s a super-convenient shortcut:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Would you look at that! We’re able to shorten e.preventDefault() to @submit.prevent. Now, we don’t even need to consider <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event"" id="""">the Event object</a> anymore!</p><h3 id="""">Tracking a loading state</h3><p id="""">The user should know when their application is loading, whether it’s posting new text to the server or just retrieving it.</p><p id="""">Let’s create a variable that tracks when our component is sending/receiving data to/from the server. We’re gonna be using <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html"" id="""">reactive variables</a>.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">What is a <strong id="""">reactive variable</strong>?</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Consider the following scenario:</li></ul><div></div><p id="""">‍<br></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Say that we updated the value in a to 5. One thing we know for sure is that the <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;p&gt;</a> element won’t change. It will always say “4”, unless we explicitly change it.</li><li id="""">Well, we don’t have to! With <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html"" id="""">reactivity</a>, the DOM is automatically updated once the related variable is mutated.</li><li id="""">In Vue, reactive variables are created with ref, a function that takes any value and makes it reactive.</li></ul><div></div><p id="""">‍<br></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Notice the addition of .value. It’s important, because if we did a = 5 we’d completely taking away the reactivity of the variable.</li><li id="""">Also, it doesn’t matter that a is a constant variable, because we’re only assigning to its .value property.</li><li id="""">Now look at the HTML:</li></ul><div></div><p id="""">‍<br></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Vue will replace {{ a }} with its value: a.value, and the double-brackets are <em id="""">not</em> optional.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Okay, let’s head right back into the submit logic. We’ll create a new isLoading reactive variable, which will indicate when our app is in-contact with the server.</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Getting user input from form elements</h3><p id="""">Our “new modal” component can’t exist without the <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;textarea&gt;</a> form element. But this raises an important question: <em id="""">how do we keep the javascript code in-sync with the DOM content?</em></p><p id="""">In a nutshell, Vue has a shortcut way of dealing with form elements. And it’s quite convenient!</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">As you can see, message is a reactive variable, so whenever the user types something into textarea, message will be instantly updated. That’s the magic of v-model!</p><p id="""">Hey! You may be getting tired from typing .value all the time. Thankfully, Vue has plans to change that.</p><h3 id="""">Making the modal inert while loading</h3><div></div><p id="""">When our app is loading (which is tracked by the isLoading variable that we saw in a previous section), we should disable interaction with it.</p><p id="""">This requires us getting access to a DOM element in JavaScript. The pure way of doing that is with body.querySelector(), but this approach is non-reactive. Plus, there’s a simpler alternative offered by Vue:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">These are called <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html"" id="""">template refs</a>! And although it says null, Vue will fill container with the DOM element &lt;div ref=""container""&gt; when it’s created. It will also go back to null when it disappears.</p><p id="""">With this in hand, we can make our component inert while it’s loading:</p><div></div><p id="""">Hey! While there’s a simpler way to achieve the above (<a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;div :inert=""isLoading""&gt;</a>), I just had to create an opportunity to teach you about template refs, which are a pretty important feature in VueJS.</p><h3 id="""">Automatically focusing the &lt;textarea&gt;</h3><div></div><p id="""">When the user opens the NewModal component, we know that their objective is to input into the <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;textarea&gt;</a>.

However, in our application, the “mounted” hook was more than enough. But just keep one thing in mind, you’ll see this concept again and again in every framework.</p><h3 id="""">Closing the modal when clicked outside</h3><div></div><p id="""">It’s a pretty common behavior in every modal to close it once the user clicks outside.</p><p id="""">In this step, we’ll take a HUGE shortcut. Instead of manually implementing this behavior, we shall use another library to do it for us.</p><p id="""">The Vue community is humongous and infinitely helpful, so it’s not a surprise to find a library like <a href=""https://vueuse.org/functions"" id="""">@vueuse</a>: over 200 useful methods that cover almost every possible use–case.</p><p id="""">Our interest lies in the [onClickOutside event](<a href=""https://vueuse.org/core/onClickOutside/"" id="""">https://vueuse.org/core/onClickOutside/</a>), which is triggered every time the user clicks outside a certain DOM element.</p><p id="""">After <a href=""https://vueuse.org/guide/"" id="""">setting up @vueuse</a>, let’s add it to our component:</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Fascinating how in one line of code, we’re able to implement such a seemingly complicating feature!</p><h3 id="""">Closing the modal</h3><p id="""">The modal has no way of telling whether its opened or closed, as only its parent — App.vue — knows such information.</p><p id="""">But there’s one thing we know to be true, and it’s that the modal knows <em id="""">when</em> it should be closed:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">user clicked outside,</li><li id="""">user submitted,</li><li id="""">user canceled.</li></ul><p id="""">Therefore, we need a way for the child — NewModal — to communicate with its parent, App. And the solution is quite simple: <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html"" id="""">Events</a>!</p><p id="""">With Vue, it’s super-simple to define our own events, while dictating when they should be emitted, using <em id="""">our</em> own rules.</p><div></div><p id="""">Henceforth, whenever the modal needs to be closed, we emit the event “close” up into its parent.</p><p id="""">Hey! Notice how we didn’t import defineEmits. That’s because it’s a compiler macro, so it’s always there by default.</p><h3 id="""">Using our custom component</h3><p id="""">Up until now, you couldn’t see NewModal, because it hasn’t been added to App.vue yet. So, let’s change that:</p><div></div><p id="""">With the code snippet above, the modal will always be open. So, let’s add some toggle magic:</p><div></div><p id="""">We took advantage of <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">v-if</a> to show/hide the modal.</p><p id="""">And now we’re done with the NewModal component. Pretty simple, huh?</p><h3 id="""">Creating a dynamic list of DOM elements</h3><div></div><p id="""">It’s time to delve into a new component, ThoughtList. This one will display a list of items, and we don’t know the length of that list before-hand.</p><p id="""">Let’s create a new file at <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">src/ThoughtList.vue</a>. In Vue, here’s how we repeat an element:</p><div></div><p id="""">Surprisingly simple! It might be useful to split this component into two: <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtList.vue</a> and <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtItem.vue</a>.</p><p id="""">So, we’ll change <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">src/ThoughtList.vue</a> to:</p><div></div><p id="""">and the new <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtItem.vue</a> will contain:</p><div></div><p id="""">And of course, don’t forget to add it to <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">App.vue</a>:</p><div></div><h3 id="""">Passing text from parent to child</h3><p id="""">We’ve seen how to trigger events from child to parent, and now, it’s time to <em id="""">flip</em> that formula around.</p><p id="""">Currently, our <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtItem</a> displays the same text: “Hello world!”</p><p id="""">But we want to show real data, which is held by the parent — <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtList</a> — in the <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">items</a> reactive variable.</p><p id="""">The solution to this problem is called <strong id="""">Props</strong> (properties). They’re like HTML attributes, if they could contain <em id="""">anything</em>! (arrays, objects, and even functions!)</p><p id="""">So let’s make a little change to <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtList.vue</a>:</p><div></div><p id="""">Hey! It’s important to add the colon : before the prop name. It tells Vue to treat the content between ""..."" as JavaScript code (the item variable), instead of a String (the text ""item"").</p><p id="""">And now, we can access the text message in <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">ThoughtItem</a> effortlessly:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">Hey! Just like defineEmits, defineProps is a compiler macro and doesn’t require importing.</p><h3 id="""">Loading data from the server</h3><p id="""">Up until now, we only used mock data. So, let’s change that! We’ll be getting data from an external API.</p><p id="""">But first, notice that we’ll need to access our API from two separate components: ThoughtList for retrieving all items, and NewModal for adding new items to the <a href=""https://docs.cyclic.sh/docs/concepts/database"" id="""">l</a>ist.</p><p id="""">This is called a <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management.html#what-is-state-management"" id="""">shared-state</a> between multiple components. There’s no immediately obvious way of solving this issue, but thankfully, there’s an entire library designed just for that, and it’s called <a href=""https://pinia.vuejs.org/"" id="""">Pinia</a>.</p><p id="""">This is where we’ll start working with the stores/ folder. So let’s create the src/stores/thoughts.js file.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/62e02ef269d01d02c0b009f1_pinia.png"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">A store should always resemble this boilerplate, so use it as a starting-point:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">We created a store with the ""thoughts"" ID name.</p><p id="""">But <em id="""">what</em> is a store, you may ask? It’s simply a collection of reactive variables and methods that act on them:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">Notice how we don’t have to use .value here. Awesome!</p><p id="""">Now, let’s create an actually useful store:</p><div></div><p id="""">All we did here is declare an items reactive variable that will contain our most important data. We then defined the load method that should be called to load data from the server and assign it to items.</p><p id="""">We also defined the add action, which asynchronously sends data to the server and adds it to the items list.</p><h3 id="""">Using real data in our application</h3><div></div><p id="""">Let’s connect our thoughts store with our application! We’ll start with NewModal:</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">We extracted the add function from the store by calling it as a function. Here, we called it getThoughtsStore, which is a convention when using Pinia.</p><p id="""">Would you believe me if I told you that was it? Well, I never lie.</p><p id="""">Let’s move into ThoughtList, which will load data from the server in order to display it.</p><div></div><p id="""">And we also have to access the items reactive variable straight from the store. So let’s follow the same pattern here:</p><div></div><p id="""">But counter-intuitively, this breaks the reactivity of the variable. Here’s the right way of doing this:</p><div></div><p id="""">Perfect!</p><p id="""">Notice how in our previous code example, we’re using a top-level await to load the data in ThoughtList:</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Components with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46515764/how-can-i-use-async-await-at-the-top-level"" id="""">top-level awaits</a> are called <strong id="""">async components</strong>.</p><p id="""">If we leave it like this, we’re gonna get the following error: (check your devtools console)</p><p id="""">Component <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;Anonymous&gt;</a>: setup function returned a promise, but no <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;Suspense&gt;</a> boundary was found in the parent component tree. A component with async setup() must be nested in a <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;Suspense&gt;</a> in order to be rendered.</p><p id="""">It’s telling us that we should use a component called <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;Suspense&gt;</a> as a parent to the <a href=""https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async.html"" id="""">async component</a>. <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;Suspense&gt;</a> (see: https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense.html) is a built-in Vue component, so we can use it anywhere in our app. Let’s use it in App.vue:</p><div></div><p id="""">It now works <em id="""">perfectly</em>! Yay!</p><h3 id="""">Adding a loading state to our list</h3><div></div><p id="""">Currently, our ThoughtList component will be invisible until data is loaded. That’s inconvenient, and makes a great example of <a href=""https://pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-loading-feedback/"" id="""">bad UX</a>.</p><p id="""">Thankfully, since we’re already using <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;Suspense&gt;</a>, we can directly tell it to show something else while its child is loading. Add this to App.vue:</p><p id="""">‍</p><div></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">As you can see, anything within <a href=""http://code-inline"" id="""">&lt;template #fallback&gt;</a> will be shown when ThoughtList is loading.

The goal here is efficiency and the mitigation of risk to lunchtime and as always, the secondary objective to expose the truth about how the PR comment you left was ignored and best practices spitefully neglected.</p><p><strong>1.

Some of these off-the-record/alternative-record things covered in triage include:</p><ul><li>Configuration changes made to toggle features</li><li>New users introduced never before seen behaviors</li><li>Off-cycle hot-fixes deployed from feature branches</li></ul><p>These three, plus the normal sprint work is at best recorded into only four different systems of record. Each of the systems is almost certainly the best tool for its job and each probably even has excellent integration capabilities. Unfortunately, the four are integrated manually in excel by four different people producing out-of-sync csv exports.</p><p><strong>6.

They've escalated pissed-ness from <a href=""http://code-inline"">CRITICAL</a> to <a href=""http://code-inline"">SHOWSTOPPER</a> (from the resting baseline of <a href=""http://code-inline"">URGENT</a>). They are asking for an ETA on the resolution and hourly updates on the status.</p><p>Large organizations have <em>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) </em>and <em>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</em> standards for disaster/outage scenarios. RTO/RPO can be internal standards or sometimes compliance requirements. What RPO/RTO actually means is best illustrated with an example:</p><p><em>If you're playing a video game - a crash is a disaster. The time it takes to boot the game back up is the recovery time. When the game starts back up, you've lost some progress time and have to start from an earlier autosave - thats the recovery point.</em></p><p>The goal is to have systems in place to maintain business continuity by reducing data loss and minimizing downtime for end users. This is done by deploying redundant infrastructure and data backups in alternate locations since physical infrastructure is geographically vulnerable.</p><h1>Recovery Strategy</h1><p>The org's AWS technical account manager tries to reassure everyone by confirming that issue is <strong>only regional</strong>. Having seen an amazing disaster recovery demo from the tech team six months ago, an executive on the call, feeling like they're about to save the day asks:</p><ul><li>`""We built DR capability. Why can't we recover to east-2?""</li></ul><p>This is where we discover that DR capability is different from a DR demo proving that failover is possible. Software changes over time. If there is an expectation that the application has recovery capability, each change must be made with the consideration for how it will behave in failure scenarios. To be clear - not try/except wrapping some new code for some feature - but how will the system with this new code and feature behave when infrastructure around it starts to break. <strong>Adopting DR is a culture change that goes beyond the developer.</strong> Maintaining availability requires continuous overhead in time and effort on development, management and architecture.</p><p>The answer is to this question is as usual -</p><ul><li>""We could try it but we're not sure what would happen, we have to ask the devops lead, but they're out today.""</li></ul><p>The contributing factors to this lack of confidence come from those same nuances of the <a href=""http://code-inline"">What did we change last?</a> question.</p><p>When the devops lead is finally located. They remember that something has changed since the DR demo. The recovery process has changed and someone has to write an additional script. They explain the functionality briefly but unfortunately they can't do it. They have “a hard stop” and have “to drop” to watch their pets and children on their day off.&nbsp; They will then hand-off to you.</p><p>35 highly paid managers on the call that are normally skeptical of pair programming -&nbsp; become an engaged operating theater audience to a couple of developers <a href=""https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/write-shitty-code"">hacking together a script</a> that will never make it to version control.</p><p>When the script is finally written, <strong>a decision must be made.</strong></p><h1>“Ok should we run it?“</h1><p>The story has had a number of twists so far. It was determined that the original recovery plan is out of date and had to be duct taped back together. The plan's original creators have given their warnings and <strong>someone new must own the success or failure of the recovery</strong>. The decision should be made with caution of course, and so, the risks need to be discussed.</p><p>QA will list the environments they would like the script to be tested in, the business execs will bring up the need to work together on this with other organizational units. A few more people will join the call for a final per-hour burn rate approaching a developer’s monthly salary.</p><p><strong>AWS will inevitably fix us-east-1, and very probably before the discussion concludes.</strong> Someone will interrupt to announce:</p><ul><li>""We're seeing less failures, looks like we're good!""</li></ul><p>Everyone congratulates everyone on their hard work.

From all these passionate discussions and online comments I have distilled a taxonomy of the dimensions of debt. What makes a reasoned discussion difficult is that they trade different quantities (mostly unmeasured) of different units across time with different potential probabilities of happening.,"<div></div><blockquote>I have written previously about how we, as technical professionals, <a href=""/posts/we-sound-like-idiots-when-we-talk-about-technical-debt"">misuse the term debt and end up sounding like idiots</a> in a business context. This is meant as a companion, to help better communicate, to our non-professional colleagues, what we mean when we say ""technical debt"".</blockquote><p>‍<br></p><p>As a software professional for almost 20 years (do I get a watch or plaque soon?) I've had more passionate discussions about technical debt than any other topic. It is right up there with the iconic 3rd rail topics: Tabs-v-Spaces, Mac-v-Windows, Java-v-Python and type systems.</p><p><br></p><p>From all these passionate discussions and online comments I have distilled a taxonomy of the dimensions of debt. All these types of debt at their core describe a trade off in time. Meaning they have a now vs later quality. What makes a reasoned discussion difficult is that they trade different quantities (mostly unmeasured) of different units across time with different potential probabilities of happening.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what a decision of technical debt could sound like applied to a non-software example. You take your car into the shop since the check engine light came on. The mechanic finds a slow leak in the radiator and offers you the following choices:</p><ul><li>do nothing, risking totaling the car if the engine over heats</li><li>have it resolved in 15 mins for $25, by adding coolant, then $25 every month going forward, otherwise #badthingshappen</li><li>have it patched by end of day for $150 but then be back in the same position if/when the patch fails</li><li>have it replaced for $300 but your car will be in the shop for a week for parts to be ordered</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>So which is the best solution? Which do you pick?</h4><p><br></p><p>Well, that is impossible to answer. There is no right answer.</p><p><br></p><p>In this example it depends on:</p><ul><li>your expected rate of some future events (how long will patch last? will leak get worse?)</li><li>your need for the car to be working now (are you leaving on road trip vacation tomorrow?)</li><li>your expected amount of future use of the car (are you planning to sell the car soon?)</li><li>your bank account balance? (do you have any money?)</li><li>your expected future cash flows (do you get paid next friday?)</li><li>cost to borrow money (how much does your credit card charge?)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It is trivial to construct a scenario where the ""obvious"" choice would be any one of those options. The dimensions of the choice are:</p><ul><li>amount of money now vs later</li><li>time till the car is working</li><li>expected usage of the car in the future</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Below is my attempt to at least describe and name the dimensions of technical debt akin to naming technical design patterns. If you think I missed a type or mischaracterized a type please tell me on twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/seekayel"">@seekayel</a></p><p><br></p><h1>Dimensions of Debt</h1><h2>Change time cost</h2><p>Cost:</p><ul><li>Any future changes take more time.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>How you will hear it described:</p><ul><li>If we want to make changes later we will first have to undue this work</li><li>Next time we will first have to do x, y, z before we can make a change</li><li>This will make unscheduled Project ABC that we want harder</li><li>This is brittle and is more likely to break on the next change (increased error rate)</li><li>On boarding/teaching new people is harder</li><li>This is a tax on future changes</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Financial Similarities:</p><ul><li>Bad credit score - all future borrowing will be more expensive</li><li>Currency wide inflation/devaluation - all future consumption becomes more expensive (assuming you are on a fixed income)</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Runtime cost</h2><p>Cost:</p><ul><li>Fixed cost in time per unit of time (eg 2hrs per week)</li><li>Fixed cost in time per unit of system usage (eg 1hr per 1,000 user signups)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>How you will hear it described:</p><ul><li>We have to spend X hours of support per week</li><li>20% of our staff hours works on escalations</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Financial Translations</p><ul><li>Interest only loan - will need to continue to pay until you pay off principle</li><li>Selling/Buying insurance</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Opportunity Cost</h2><p>Cost:</p><ul><li>Whole sets of features aren't considered or built due to existing code/system/design</li></ul><p><br></p><p>How you will hear it described:</p><ul><li>We don't build X or Y</li><li>We don't measure/report on X or Y</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Financial Similarities:</p><ul><li>Sunk cost fallacy</li><li>Do you transition the same factory from producing lower value product to higher value product</li><li>Career transition: forgo income, training/education expense, moving costs for future income</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Interpretation:</p><p>This can be confused with the argument that actions aren't taken because the cost is too high. The focus here should be on the Opportunity that is missed. What could be but isn't, instead of the cost of what is.</p><p><br><br></p><h2>Organizational Risk<br></h2><p>Cost:</p><ul><li>The organization assumes: financial, reputational, operational or recruiting/retention risk.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>How it is described:</p><ul><li>If X happens we will have to spend Y days scrambling to fix</li><li>If it breaks we will have an outage</li><li>If it breaks we will have a PR disaster/go out of business</li><li>If it breaks we will be open to legal liability</li><li>If it breaks we will have a security incident</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Financial Similarities:</p><ul><li>Selling uncovered puts</li><li>Selling uncovered calls</li><li>Uninsured against fire/flood/earthquake</li><li>Forgivable 0% interest only loan, but potential for demand payment</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Interpretation:</p><p>This can be considered a compound dimension. It could include both the probability that the potential risk occurs along with the probable distribution of potential outcomes. For maximum clarity of communication I would suggest this dimension be discussed as the range of severity of the outcome, if the potential risk comes to pass.</p><p>‍</p><p><br></p><h2>Money Cost<br></h2><p>Cost:</p><ul><li>The organization pays more money aka US Dollars ($) than is strictly necessary.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>How it is described:</p><ul><li>The servers are too ""big""</li><li>The clusters aren't sized ""right""</li><li>We need to optimize process X for less memory</li><li>We need to archive some/all of our data/logs</li><li>We need to turn off things are aren't using</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Financial Similarities:</p><ul><li>That gym membership that still is charged to your card each month even though you don't go.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Interpretation:</p><p>This is pretty straight forward, everyone in the organization understands dollars as a unit of cost. Where this is becomes more complicated is in the tradeoffs for any change with: how long it will take, what risk the organization assumes implementing it and the project coordination time to ensure one team's waste isn't another teams KPI.</p><p>‍</p><h1>Postscript<br></h1><p>As a business person you will probably be more concerned about Opportunity Cost and Organizational Risk than Runtime Cost or Change Time Cost. What this means for developers is thinking how a particular project you would like prioritized maps to either Opportunity Cost or Organizational Risk is probably a more effective argument than the same for Runtime or Change time costs.</p><p><br><br></p>"

There is nothing extraordinary about my VC experiences. I have done the following: raised an angel round and two institutional rounds (and failed at two rounds?) at a company I co-founded in the GovTech/Community space (SeeClickFix). I have participated in pitches as CTO of a pre-PMF (product market fit) mortgage tech company (HeavyWater). I have raised a friends-and-family round at my current Cloud Infrastructure company (<a href=""https://www.cyclic.sh"">https://www.cyclic.sh</a>)</p><p>‍</p><p>The venture funding landscape is evolving. It seems there is more innovation now than at any other time. My goal here is to explain the general case so that you have a reference point for understanding the more novel or innovative approaches. Aka there are exceptions to everything here, but first let us learn the base case.</p><p>‍</p><p>The majority of the confusion or difficulty I had raising Venture Capital was that I didn’t fully understand the VC business model. I didn’t understand the individual investors and their incentives. I didn’t appreciate the incentives for the fund itself. Nor did I understand what the fund’s investors (Limited Partners aka LPs) were expecting. Hopefully this will help you understand what I didn’t.</p><p>‍</p><h1>The VC business model</h1><p>‍</p><p>Venture funds are companies. Their purpose for existence is to make money from making investments in other companies.</p><p>‍</p><p>They are composed of Limited Partners (LPs) and a General Partner (GP). The GP is the company owned and run by the ""VC"" you meet at some networking event. The VC has formed these companies and raised money from LPs. Part of the structure of the fund is that it will exist for no more than 10 years. At the end of that time all proceeds or investment holdings will be sent back to the LPs (minus any fees for the GP).</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/625dce5fe5890977b45753cb_vc-structure-angellist.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>VC Fund Structure (photo credit <a href=""https://learn.angellist.com/articles/venture-capital-fund#toc_8_H2"">Angel List</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The LPs invest in the fund because they want to make money. The “Limited” in LP refers to the time the investor doesn’t spend working in the business. They send a check and that is their involvement.</p><p>‍</p><p>The VC formed the GP and raised money from the LPs because they want to make money. The GP charges a management fee of 2% per year on assets the LP invests with the fund.</p><p>‍</p><p>The GP will charge carry, aka 20% of any profits from the investments they make. The LPs get to first recover their initial investment, including those 2% fees, then any additional profits are shared with the GP.</p><p>‍</p><h1>The Lifecycle of a single VC fund</h1><p>‍</p><p>Just as VC funds have standard structures and standard fees, they have a standard development and lifecycle. Understanding where a particular fund is in this progression will help you understand their expected behavior. Also, a single VC might have multiple funds that are in different stages of this trajectory. I have found that VCs are very open and willing to talk about which fund they are actively investing out of, how big it is, when they raised it and their average check size. I have always been able to find this information by asking.</p><p>‍</p><h2>First Years: Load up the Plate</h2><p>‍</p><p>As a new entrepreneur I didn't realize how critical time fit with a VC was. After they raise from their investors (LPs) they are on a time crunch to get the money invested. They want to invest in good companies but they only have about 1-3 years to invest. This means it is much easier to raise from a VC who has just raised. They are rapidly putting money to work. They just arrived at the buffet with an empty plate. Everything looks good and they don't have anything that is a better alternative already on their plate.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Middle Years: Getting Picky</h2><p>‍</p><p>After that first phase they transition into a slower but still active investment role. In this 4-6 year middle window a VC will still take meetings but are much less likely to make new investments. At this phase they have a full plate but are still wandering around the buffet looking for great options. The threshold is now higher for inclusion. They may prefer the truffle parm fries they just found (your company), but they already have cajun curly fries which are almost as good (a company they already invested in). However they may have raised a new fund so they could be in two phases at once - make sure to ask!</p><p>‍</p><p>These VCs won't tell you that they probably won't invest. They are happy to ask questions and probe into your business. They get tremendous market intelligence from taking these meetings. They get to see:</p><ul><li>What people are pitching (deal flow)</li></ul><ul><li>How is the market is responding to these pitches?</li></ul><ul><li>Do you raise quickly? Do you struggle to raise? At what price? On what terms?</li></ul><ul><li>Benchmark strategy data for their current portfolio companies eg Are social ads working? What is your customer acquisition cost? What are your churn rates?</li></ul><ul><li>Potential insights for their current portfolio companies</li></ul><ul><li>Optionality of investing in an amazing company/founder eg maybe your company is the best investment they have seen in their professional life</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2>Final Years the Tail End: Finishing up</h2><p>‍</p><p>At this point they have transitioned to harvesting or running off the portfolio. They are returning funds to investors. They know that their investment fund will close after 7-10 years so this is a period of actively winding down.</p><p>‍</p><p>At the buffet they have switched to dessert and coffee. It would be an extraordinary turn of events such that you could convince them to take a scoop of some new main course. More likely they have raised another fund, probably at the end of the first year or two and any pitch would get investment from that fund. So effectively that VC is “loading their plate” even if one of their funds is in this phase of winding down.</p><p>‍</p><h1>Outcome Fit</h1><p>‍</p><p>A natural tendency when considering an endeavor (business or other) is to start with the likelihood of success. This line of thinking asks how probable each outcome is. It is a frame of thinking that trades size of outcome for certainty in outcome. Increasing certainty can raise the floor on returns, but also lower the ceiling.</p><p>‍</p><p>When the VC was raising money from LPs they put together a spreadsheet that described the basic economics of the venture fund. Roughly it modeled the following for 10 investments:</p><ul><li>5 will fail completely, the investments will be a complete loss</li></ul><ul><li>3 will do ok, they will each return somewhere between 3x</li></ul><ul><li>1 will do great, it will return 10x</li></ul><ul><li>1 will do amazing, it will return 25x+</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>This would put the fund in the top-1% of VCs. A more likely outcome of those 10 investments is:</p><ul><li>6 will fail</li><li>3 will do ok they will each return on average ~3x</li><li>1 will do great, it will return ~5x</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>This would put the VC roughly at the median returns for all VC firms.

They are evaluating if your company has the potential of returning 10-50x the investment they make. Only if the company passes that screen will they engage on if your company has a reasonable risk adjusted chance of making that outcome a reality.</p><p>‍</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>‍</p><p>The tech twitter joke of “big if true” can be a helpful tldr guide for how VCs evaluate potential investments. Make sure you know where they are in their investing lifecycle to ensure you are spending your time wisely. Hopefully this was helpful.

Without them the product is useless.,"<p>As an engineer I like to talk about the features of a product. I talk about the product’s implementation and how it was built. I get excited about the internal workings. I have spent days of my life working on features that were never used. I operated under a mental framework that users came from outside and were external to the product. I was concerned with building the product. The users would be there when I was done. So I spent most of my time heads down writing code.</p><blockquote>So I spent most of my time heads down writing code.</blockquote><p>During college I spent a whole summer internship building an automated test case generation program for network router configurations. While building that product I only did one session with the engineers I expected to use the product. It was a presentation late in the summer. I wrote no documentation.</p><p>The program was never used after I went back to school. I am sure this is a tale that is familiar to many in the software community. Spend months of time to build something that once completed is immediately scrapped.</p><blockquote>The program was never used after I went back to school.</blockquote><p>It is a cautionary tale of building without user feedback and not building usage along with building the product. At the time I told myself: the company had problems; it was their fault they couldn't see the value in the tooling I built.</p><p>Now, I have come to realize: users are a feature. They are the best feature. With users a product is alive and useful. If I want users then I need to spend time working on that feature.</p><blockquote>Users are a feature. They are the best feature. With users a product is alive and useful.</blockquote><p>There are several ways to work on the users feature. Whether I spend time acquiring, educating, activating, retaining, supporting, scaling or nurturing them, I need to do it with the same intentionality and focus as I work on any other feature. Again, users are a feature. And, they are the best, most important, and hardest feature there is.</p><p>‍</p><p>So you agree? Great! </p><p>‍</p><h4>What is next?</h4><p>How do we magically ""get"" users? Where is the “hello world” for user acquisition?

The difference between a user story taking a day or 3 days is negligible compared to its business value. Companies and their leaders care about revenue and costs. They care about customers and growth. They care about time to market. If we want to have our non-technical colleagues listen and act, we need to either improve our use of the financial terms they understand or we need to translate our message into business outcomes that they do care about.</p><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>business leaders don’t care if jobs are hard or annoying or take longer than they “should” ... we need to translate our message into business outcomes that they do care about</blockquote><p>‍<br></p><p>To capture these opportunities we need to go back to the beginning. The only way to remedy these failures in communication is to refactor our language and use of terms. We need to better define technical debt and the terms we use to describe it. The use of units of dollars is a powerful tool to communicate to those not part of the software design, build, and run value stream. Let's start with how the non-technical listener will understand the terms of debt.</p><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>using a unit of dollars is a powerful tool to communicate to those not part of building software</blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>What is Financial Debt?</h3><p><br></p><p><strong>Debt</strong> is a contractual agreement that allows the <strong>borrower</strong> to to shift future <strong>consumption</strong> into the present. This also allows the <strong>lender</strong> to do the reverse, shift present consumption into the future. The amount of consumption that is shifted is the <strong>principal</strong>. The amount that is still due at any point of time is the <strong>balance</strong>. The cost per unit of shifted consumption is the <strong>interest rate</strong>. The distance through time that the consumption is shifted is the <strong>term</strong> of the debt. The frequency and amount that is paid to service the debt is the <strong>payment schedule</strong>. All of these terms should be familiar to most consumers who have a mortgage, credit cards or a car loan.</p><p><br></p><p>Notice that there is no judgment or statement if debt is good (<strong>productive</strong>) or bad (<strong>unproductive</strong>). If you use debt to purchase a house, is that good or bad? That question can only be answered in the context of the cost of that debt (<strong>interest rate</strong>) and if you are changing your monthly consumption on housing. If your mortgage payment is less than your current rent then it is probably good debt. By borrowing money you have lowered your monthly expenses. This is a productive use of debt.</p><p><br></p><p>This view of debt is much more inline with how companies reason about their debt. The primary questions are:</p><ol start=""""><li>What is the cost of the debt?</li><li>What additional value will the debt buy?</li><li>What is the expected change to cash flow from this investment?</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Borrowing money to build a bigger factory that will enable more efficient production of your products is probably a productive use of debt. Borrowing to fund bonuses for executives is probably unproductive.</p><p><br><br></p><h3>A Different Conversation</h3><p><br></p><p>If we use these terms to communicate the technical debt we are holding as a team the communication could look like this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Techie</strong>: Oof, we had to give discounts that amounted to 1% of our sales again last month.<br></p><p><strong>Business person</strong>: Yeah but what can we do about it?<br></p><p><strong>Techie</strong>: Well, our order system is filled with technical debt. We can either keep paying with the discounts for the failed orders, or we can invest in 3-6 weeks of engineering time to half the error rate. This could delay other features.<br></p><p><strong>Business person</strong>: If you can half the error rate we can afford to hire more engineers.</p><p><br></p>"

Commitment is required by both your head and your heart.,"<p>At my last company we had a micro-services architecture. We also focused on recruiting developers who were smart and dedicated, but not yet experienced. When they started we would task them to add some new functionality. This would require on the order of perhaps 20 to 50 lines of business logic.</p><p>However this would require 500 to 1000 lines of infrastructure code. Between project setup, framework config and infrastructure as code yaml, the actual purpose of the service was drowned out. The gearing ratio was all wrong.</p><p>When these developers went to build and deploy, they would encounter more troubles. If you have ever worked with AWS you will know that CloudFormation is not known for the predictability or clarity of its errors. If you have worked with API Gateway and Lambda you will know how quickly you can get lost in a dark thicket of abstractions and frameworks, each blurring and bending into the the next.</p><p>Even when the infrastructure would provision without error the call paths and observability was lacking. The infinite power combined with the lack of knowledge of where to start reminded me of staring at the blinking command prompt the first time I loaded linux. ""Something is happening in here, I just don't know how or where""</p><p>I believe as experienced engineers we too often default to expecting those coming behind us to spend their time learning the same lessons we learned. Instead I want to clear the way for not yet experienced developers to go beyond what I have been able to accomplish. To do this we need new tools. And we need a new abstraction.</p><p>Our vision is a world where you write your hello world on your local and then publish it in a way the whole world can use it immediately. No where in that process do you size servers or design fail-over health checks. Instead you just worry about what you want to say.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>"
Write Shitty Code - why you should and feel good about it,write-shitty-code,60d0f077b69e2df6b324616c,61dde0b3def972ccb1d8c38e,Tue Jan 11 2022 19:55:31 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Feb 23 2022 16:14:59 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Feb 23 2022 16:18:06 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),kam-lasater,Engineering,false,true,Wed Jan 26 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/61e01ceaa92e5f6848495201_shitty-code-v2.png,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60d0f077b69e2d8f2d246168/61e01ceaa92e5f6848495201_shitty-code-v2.png,Why you should write MORE shitty code and feel good about it.,"<p>I know how to write good code.</p><p><br></p><p>Usually it means spending more time now to make the code better for some future state of the world. This assumes that I know what the future will look like. In software we rarely know what the future holds.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>In software we rarely know what the future holds</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Uncertainty can be caused by:</p><ul><li>Not knowing the technology</li><li>Not knowing the business</li><li>Not knowing the user</li><li>Not knowing the data size of the system</li><li>Not knowing the longevity of the code</li><li>Unknown-unknowns (see 2020 for more complete list of examples)</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>When I have uncertainty about the future, cycle time is most important. It allows me to capture value from my code by: learning as quickly as possible, minimizing impacts of bad or faulty code, as well as shortening my time to market.</p><p><br></p><p>Any friction hurts my cycle time. This decreases the rate I can turn uncertainty into certainty aka learning. My longest term value is created by learning as quickly as possible, since it is a multiplier for all future code I write or systems I design. Said another way: As “writing is re-writing”, coding is refactoring.</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>My longest term value is created by learning as quickly as possible</blockquote><p>‍<br></p><p>Here is why you should write shitty code. Or more precisely, why you should write MORE shitty code.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Build the skill of writing code</h3><p>If you want to learn how to write code the best way to develop that skill is practice. I have found I can read all I want, but I don’t retain the lesson until I type the code with my fingers. Coding is a skill that is not learned in a day. It is a way of thinking and approaching problems. It is a collection of knowledge about tools and computing environments. The only way to develop this knowledge is to use the tools and environments. Each time I write code the easier and less shitty the next time will be.</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>Each time I write code the easier and less shitty the next time will be</blockquote><p>‍<br></p><h3>Reconnect with the joy of creation</h3><p>Writing shitty code means focusing on getting to the outcome as quickly as possible. This means getting to that feeling of success and satisfaction that something, anything is working. I wrote my first line of code about three decades ago, I still get a thrill each time I get a new piece of code working.</p><p>‍</p><p><br></p><h3>Learn how code and systems fail</h3><p>Systems fail. I have found that these are the most precious opportunities to learn. My biggest learnings have come not from making some quality trade-off I anticipated, it was some behavior or input to the system that I never even considered. If I spend time building something that is “flawless” I am emotionally invested in it working. Then, when something goes wrong I look for errors external to the code I wrote.</p><p><br></p><p>When I write shitty code I have no emotional attachment to it functioning. When it fails I assume it is the weakest link and dive into learning more about the code and system. This mental state is a state of wonder and joy.</p><p><br></p><p>No code runs wholly in isolation. Each unexpected failure (by definition) is something that I didn’t understand. Therefore each failure is a perfectly crafted lesson that is adaptively constructed for me to maximize my learning.</p><p><br><br></p><h3>Learn how to debug</h3><p>When I code I have several standard loops of feedback. When I write shitty code I turn up the frequency of those feedback loops. This naturally puts pressure on me to understand where to look and how to look for output from the code I am writing. Each time I write code I learn more about my tools. I could learn a new keyboard short-cut for my editor or I could write a script for some manual step in the testing process. The point is that each time I write code I improve the quality of my tools and my understanding of those tools.</p><p><br><br></p><h3>Explore the design space</h3><p>If I am writing code to do something that I am unfamiliar with, which is basically all the code I write, because otherwise it would be refactoring, I don’t know the design space. I don’t know what is possible because I don’t know what I don’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>In drawing classes sometimes they assign variation studies. Basically you come up with 5 or 10 initial sketches from some prompt. Then you draw 5 or 10 variations of each. This is an exploration of the design space. Sometimes I find myself comparing two possible designs. This is a limitation on what is truly possible. There are more likely to be dozens of different possible designs. Writing more shitty code lets me see more of what is possible. I look up from where I stand and see the whole landscape of possibility.</p><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>Writing more shitty code lets me see more of what is possible</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Lowered expectations releases more creative energy and thoughts</h3><p>I know I mentioned this in previous reasons, however the change in emotional state I experience when I let go of the ego of my code being “right”, is monumental. Instead of feeling frustration or irritation I feel wonder, discovery, joy and a sense of accomplishment. Even if all the other reasons are wrong, the difference in personal emotional state is worth writing more shitty code.</p><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>Instead of feeling frustration or irritation I feel wonder, discovery, joy</blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>A lot of senior experienced people will talk about all the “shoulds” your code should be like. They are usually describing some far distance promised land that they have never visited either. Some of these “shoulds” are packaged as frameworks to help think through tradeoffs in system design. The best have an explicit out clause for knowing when the rules don’t apply. In the end they are helpful if they guide you, and are not if they slow you down.</p><p><br></p><p>Said another way, know where you are headed but embrace the shittyness of producing code for today.</p><p><br></p>"
